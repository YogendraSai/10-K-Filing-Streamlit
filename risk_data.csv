 Item 1A.,Market Risk
"Risk Factors 

The Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described below.",Business Risk
"When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely affected.",Business Risk
"Because of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.",Financial Risk
This discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements.,Security Risk
"This section should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II, Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; of this Form 10-K.",Financial Risk
"Macroeconomic and Industry Risks 

The Company&#8217;s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition.",Business Risk
The Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company&#8217;s total net sales.,Security Risk
"In addition, the Company&#8217;s global supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company&#8217;s supplier facilities, including manufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the U.S. As a result, the Company&#8217;s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions.",Business Risk
"Adverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, slower growth or recession, new or increased tariffs and other barriers to trade, changes to fiscal and monetary policy, tighter credit, higher interest rates, high unemployment and currency fluctuations can adversely impact consumer confidence and spending and materially adversely affect demand for the Company&#8217;s products and services.",Business Risk
"In addition, consumer confidence and spending can be materially adversely affected in response to financial market volatility, negative financial news, conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets, declines in income or asset values, energy shortages and cost increases, labor and healthcare costs and other economic factors.",Financial Risk
"In addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company&#8217;s products, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions can have a significant impact on the Company&#8217;s suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.",Business Risk
Potential effects include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance operations and purchases of the Company&#8217;s products; and insolvency.,Financial Risk
A downturn in the economic environment can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company&#8217;s trade receivables; the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the Company&#8217;s ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair value of the Company&#8217;s financial instruments.,Financial Risk
"These and other economic factors can materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.",Financial Risk
"The Company&#8217;s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price have been adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.",Business Risk
"COVID-19 has had, and continues to have, a significant impact around the world, prompting governments and businesses to take unprecedented measures in response.",Security Risk
"Such measures have included restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary closures of businesses, and quarantine and shelter-in-place orders.",Security Risk
The COVID-19 pandemic has at times significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets.,Market Risk
"The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have adversely affected and could in the future materially adversely impact the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.",Business Risk
"During the course of the pandemic, certain of the Company&#8217;s component suppliers and manufacturing and logistical service providers have experienced disruptions, resulting in supply shortages that affected sales worldwide, and similar disruptions could occur in the future.",Business Risk
Public safety measures can also adversely impact consumer demand for the Company&#8217;s products and services in affected areas.,Security Risk
"Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 5 

The Company continues to monitor the situation and take appropriate actions in accordance with the recommendations and requirements of relevant authorities.",Security Risk
"The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact the Company&#8217;s operational and financial performance remains uncertain and will depend on many factors outside the Company&#8217;s control, including the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic, the emergence of new variants, the development, availability, distribution and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products and services.",Business Risk
"Additional future impacts on the Company may include material adverse effects on demand for the Company&#8217;s products and services, the Company&#8217;s supply chain and sales and distribution channels, the Company&#8217;s ability to execute its strategic plans, and the Company&#8217;s profitability and cost structure.",Business Risk
"To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.",Business Risk
"The Company&#8217;s business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.",Business Risk
"Political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.",Business Risk
"The Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company&#8217;s total net sales, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade.",General Risk
"Substantially all of the Company&#8217;s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia, including China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam.",General Risk
"Trade policies and disputes and other international conflicts can result in tariffs, sanctions and other measures that restrict international trade, and can materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, particularly if these measures occur in regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations.",Business Risk
"For example, tensions between the U.S. and China have led to a series of tariffs being imposed by the U.S. on imports from China mainland, as well as other business restrictions.",Business Risk
Tariffs increase the cost of the Company&#8217;s products and the components and raw materials that go into making them.,Business Risk
These increased costs can adversely impact the gross margin that the Company earns on its products.,Business Risk
"Tariffs can also make the Company&#8217;s products more expensive for customers, which could make the Company&#8217;s products less competitive and reduce consumer demand.",Business Risk
"Countries may also adopt other measures, such as controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, that could adversely impact the Company&#8217;s operations and supply chain and limit the Company&#8217;s ability to offer its products and services as designed.",Business Risk
"These measures can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers, restructuring business relationships, and ceasing to offer third-party applications on its platforms.",Business Risk
"Changing the Company&#8217;s operations in accordance with new or changed trade restrictions can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company&#8217;s operations.",Business Risk
Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures.,Business Risk
"If disputes and conflicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in response could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business.",Business Risk
"Political uncertainty surrounding trade and other international disputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business.",Business Risk
"Many of the Company&#8217;s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company&#8217;s suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters.",Business Risk
"In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company&#8217;s control.",Security Risk
Global climate change is resulting in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects.,General Risk
"Such events can make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company&#8217;s supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company&#8217;s service offerings.",Business Risk
"Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales.",Business Risk
"Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company.",Business Risk
"Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 6 

The Company&#8217;s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers.",Business Risk
"While the Company&#8217;s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to the Company&#8217;s business, and harm to the Company&#8217;s reputation.",Business Risk
"Major public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the future materially adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products; the imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement of products between regions; and disruptions in the Company&#8217;s supply chain and sales and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions of the supply of current products and delays in production ramps of new products.",Business Risk
"While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise.",Financial Risk
"Global markets for the Company&#8217;s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets.",Technology Risk
"The Company&#8217;s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses.",Market Risk
"The Company&#8217;s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace.",Technology Risk
"The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services.",Technology Risk
"As a result, the Company must make significant investments in R&#38;D. There can be no assurance these investments will achieve expected returns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully.",Business Risk
"The Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to register, additional patents, trademarks and copyrights.",Technology Risk
"In contrast, many of the Company&#8217;s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company&#8217;s products and infringing on its intellectual property.",Market Risk
Effective intellectual property protection is not consistently available in every country in which the Company operates.,Legal Risk
"If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Company&#8217;s intellectual property, the Company&#8217;s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be materially adversely affected.",Business Risk
"The Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets.",Market Risk
"The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships.",Market Risk
"In addition, some of the Company&#8217;s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices.",Market Risk
Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins.,Market Risk
"Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss.",Business Risk
Some of the markets in which the Company competes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall.,Market Risk
"Additionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company&#8217;s product features and applications within their products or collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer.",Market Risk
The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the Company&#8217;s approach to providing components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions.,Market Risk
"The Company&#8217;s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases.",Market Risk
The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free.,Market Risk
The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications.,Market Risk
"The Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition depend substantially on the Company&#8217;s ability to continually improve its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages.",Business Risk
There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively.,Business Risk
"Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 7 

Business Risks 

To remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services.",Business Risk
"Due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the markets and industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services, and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services.",Business Risk
"The success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors, including timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company&#8217;s ability to manage the risks associated with production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for the Company&#8217;s products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies.",Market Risk
There can be no assurance the Company will successfully manage future introductions and transitions of products and services.,Business Risk
"The Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are located outside of the U.S.",Business Risk
"Substantially all of the Company&#8217;s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia, including China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, and a significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations.",Market Risk
Changes or additions to the Company&#8217;s supply chain require considerable time and resources and involve significant risks and uncertainties.,Business Risk
The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management.,Market Risk
"While these arrangements can lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company&#8217;s direct control over production and distribution.",Business Risk
"Such diminished control has from time to time and may in the future have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products manufactured or services provided, or adversely affect the Company&#8217;s flexibility to respond to changing conditions.",Business Risk
"Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product defects and experiences unanticipated product defect liabilities from time to time.",Business Risk
"While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from time to time and can materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.",Business Risk
"The Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company&#8217;s hardware products.",Market Risk
Any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the Company&#8217;s cost or supply of components or finished goods.,Business Risk
"In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, armed conflict, economic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, or international trade disputes.",Business Risk
"The Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements.",Business Risk
"While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be reduced or terminated, and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted.",Financial Risk
Future operating results depend upon the Company&#8217;s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms.,Business Risk
"Because the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks.",Market Risk
"Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that can materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition.",Business Risk
"For example, the global semiconductor industry is experiencing high demand and shortages of supply, which has adversely affected, and could materially adversely affect, the Company&#8217;s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components and products on commercially reasonable terms or at all.",Market Risk
"While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.",Business Risk
"Component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company&#8217;s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms or at all.",Financial Risk
"The effects of global or regional economic conditions on the Company&#8217;s suppliers, described in &#8220; The Company&#8217;s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition, &#8221; above, can also affect the Company&#8217;s ability to obtain components .",Business Risk
"Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.",Business Risk
"Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 8 

The Company&#8217;s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source.",Technology Risk
"When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers&#8217; yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased.",Technology Risk
"The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company&#8217;s requirements.",Market Risk
"When the Company&#8217;s supply of components for a new or existing product has been delayed or constrained, or when an outsourcing partner has delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition.",Business Risk
"The Company&#8217;s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source.",Business Risk
The Company&#8217;s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business and result in harm to the Company&#8217;s reputation.,Business Risk
The Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects.,Technology Risk
"Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products.",Technology Risk
Defects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties.,Business Risk
Component defects could make the Company&#8217;s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury.,Business Risk
"These risks may increase as the Company&#8217;s products are introduced into specialized applications, including health.",Business Risk
"In addition, the Company&#8217;s service offerings can have quality issues and from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors.",General Risk
"As a result, the Company&#8217;s services from time to time have not performed as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations.",Business Risk
"There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services it offers.",Technology Risk
Failure to do so can result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the Company&#8217;s products and services.,Technology Risk
"In addition, the Company can be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant and equipment, and/or intangible assets, and significant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines.",Legal Risk
"Quality problems can also adversely affect the experience for users of the Company&#8217;s products and services, and result in harm to the Company&#8217;s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales.",Business Risk
"The Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk.",Financial Risk
"The Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value.",Business Risk
The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components.,Business Risk
"The Company reviews long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers&#8217; facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable.",Business Risk
"If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value.",Financial Risk
"Although the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable, there can be no assurance the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes.",Business Risk
The Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments.,Market Risk
"Manufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company&#8217;s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for periods up to 150 days.",Market Risk
"Because the Company&#8217;s markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.",Market Risk
"The Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all.",Business Risk
"The Company&#8217;s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which requires licenses from those third parties.",Legal Risk
"In addition, because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company currently competes or in the future may compete, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, the Company&#8217;s products and services can unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others.",Technology Risk
"From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties.",Legal Risk
"Based on experience and industry practice, the Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially reasonable terms.",Legal Risk
"However, there can be no assurance the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all.",Legal Risk
"Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, can preclude the Company from selling certain products or services, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition.",Business Risk
"Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 9 

The Company&#8217;s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers.",Technology Risk
The Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and services.,Technology Risk
There can be no assurance third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Company&#8217;s products.,Technology Risk
"If third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company&#8217;s products, customers may choose not to buy the Company&#8217;s products.",Market Risk
"The Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers&#8217; perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the Company&#8217;s products compared to competitors&#8217; platforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets, Windows for personal computers and tablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for gaming platforms.",Market Risk
"This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of product sales, and the costs of developing such applications and services.",Market Risk
"The Company&#8217;s minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets can make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company&#8217;s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors&#8217; products with larger market share.",Market Risk
"When developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company&#8217;s devices can suffer.",Technology Risk
The Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products.,Technology Risk
"The Company&#8217;s products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and when third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, their applications can fail to take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences and can operate incorrectly and can result in dissatisfied customers.",Technology Risk
The Company distributes third-party applications for its products through the App Store.,Technology Risk
"For the vast majority of applications, developers keep all of the revenue they generate on the App Store.",Technology Risk
The Company only retains a commission from sales of applications and sales of digital services or goods within an application.,Market Risk
"From time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to competition, market and legal conditions.",Market Risk
The Company may make further business changes in the future.,Business Risk
"New legislative initiatives, such as the European Union (&#8220;EU&#8221;) Digital Markets Act, could require further changes.",Market Risk
"The Company is also subject to litigation and investigations relating to the App Store, which have resulted in changes to the Company&#8217;s business practices, and may in the future result in further changes.",Legal Risk
These changes could include how and to what extent the Company charges developers for access to its platforms and manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store.,Technology Risk
"This could reduce the volume of sales, and the commission that the Company earns on those sales, would decrease.",Business Risk
"If the rate of the commission that the Company retains on such sales is reduced, or if it is otherwise narrowed in scope or eliminated, the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.",Business Risk
"Failure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the Company&#8217;s customers, or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition.",Business Risk
The Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers.,Technology Risk
"This includes the right to sell, or offer subscriptions to, third-party content, as well as the right to incorporate specific content into the Company&#8217;s own services.",Market Risk
"The licensing or other distribution arrangements for this content can be for relatively short time periods and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.",Legal Risk
"Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and can take actions to make it difficult or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content.",Market Risk
"Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company&#8217;s access to, or increase the cost of, such content.",Market Risk
The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules.,Business Risk
"The Company also produces its own digital content, which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing competition for talent, content and subscribers, and may fail to appeal to the Company&#8217;s customers.",Market Risk
The COVID-19 pandemic has also caused additional restrictions on production and increased costs for digital content.,Market Risk
Some third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions.,Security Risk
"If requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions.",Technology Risk
There can be no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner.,Market Risk
"Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 10 

The Company&#8217;s success depends largely on the talents and efforts of its team members, the continued service and availability of highly skilled employees, including key personnel, and the Company&#8217;s ability to nurture its distinctive and inclusive culture.",Technology Risk
"Much of the Company&#8217;s future success depends on the talents and efforts of its team members, the continued availability and service of key personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly skilled employees.",General Risk
"Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley, where most of the Company&#8217;s key personnel are located.",Market Risk
"In addition to intense competition for talent, workforce dynamics are constantly evolving.",Market Risk
"If the Company does not manage changing workforce dynamics effectively, it could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s culture, reputation and operational flexibility.",Business Risk
The Company believes that its distinctive and inclusive culture is a significant driver of its success.,General Risk
"If the Company is unable to nurture its culture, it could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s ability to recruit and retain the highly skilled employees who are critical to its success, and could otherwise materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.",Business Risk
"The Company depends on the performance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellers.",Market Risk
"The Company distributes its products and certain of its services through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers, many of which distribute products and services from competitors.",Market Risk
"The Company also sells its products and services and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force.",Market Risk
"Some carriers providing cellular network service for the Company&#8217;s products offer financing, installment payment plans or subsidies for users&#8217; purchases of the device.",Market Risk
There can be no assurance such offers will be continued at all or in the same amounts.,Market Risk
"The Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers&#8217; stores with Company employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays.",Market Risk
These programs can require a substantial investment while not assuring return or incremental sales.,Technology Risk
"The financial condition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Company&#8217;s products, or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Company&#8217;s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company&#8217;s products.",Financial Risk

Product transitions are complex and frequently negatively impact our revenue as we often ship both new and legacy architecture products simultaneously and we and our channel partners prepare to ship and support new products.,Market Risk
"Our architecture transitions of Data Center, Professional Visualization, and Gaming products may impair our ability to predict demand and impact our supply mix.",Technology Risk
"Qualification time for new products, customers anticipating product transitions and channel partners reducing channel inventory of legacy architectures ahead of new product introductions can create reductions or volatility in our revenue.",Business Risk
"We have experienced and may in the future experience reduced demand for current generation architectures when customers anticipate transitions, and we may be unable to sell multiple product architectures at the same time for current and future architecture transitions.",Market Risk
"While we have managed prior product transitions and have previously sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult and prior trends may not continue.",Market Risk
"If we are unable to execute our architectural transitions as planned for any reason, our financial results may be negatively impacted.",Financial Risk
"We sell most of our products through channel partners, who sell to distributors, retailers, and/or end customers.",Market Risk
"As a result, the decisions made by our channel partners, distributors, retailers, and in response to changing market conditions and changes in end user demand for our products have impacted and could in the future continue to impact our ability to properly forecast demand, particularly as they are based on estimates provided by various downstream parties.",Business Risk
"If we underestimate our customers' future demand for our products, our foundry partners may not have adequate lead-time or capacity to increase production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill orders on a timely basis.",Business Risk
"Even if we are able to increase production levels to meet customer demand, we may not be able to do so in a cost-effective or timely manner, or our contract manufacturers may experience supply constraints.",Business Risk
"If we fail to fulfill our customers&#8217; orders on a timely basis, or at all, our customer relationships could be damaged, we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be harmed.",Business Risk
"If we overestimate our customers&#8217; future demand for our products, or if customers cancel or defer orders or choose to purchase from our competitors, we may not be able to reduce our inventory or other contractual purchase commitments.",Business Risk
"In the past, we have experienced a reduction in average selling prices, including due to channel pricing programs that we have implemented and may continue to implement, as a result of our overestimation of future demand, and we may need to continue these reductions.",Market Risk
"We have had to increase prices for certain of our products as a result of our suppliers&#8217; increase in prices, and we may need to continue to do so for other products in the future.",Business Risk
"We have also written-down our inventory, incurred cancellation penalties, and recorded impairments.",Business Risk
"These impacts were amplified by our placement of non-cancellable and non-returnable purchasing terms, well in advance of our historical lead times and could be exacerbated if we need to make changes to the design of future products.",Business Risk
"The risk of these impacts has increased as our purchase obligations and prepaids have grown and become a greater portion of our total supply while our 

revenue has sequentially declined.",Business Risk
All of these factors may negatively impact our gross margins and financial results.,Financial Risk
We build technology and products for use cases and applications that may be new or may not yet exist.,Market Risk
Examples include our Omniverse platform and third-party large language models and generative models.,General Risk
"Our demand estimates for these use cases and applications can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue or supply levels, and we may not be able to generate any revenue from these use cases and applications.",Business Risk
Challenges in estimating demand could become more pronounced or volatile in the future on both a global and regional basis.,Market Risk
"Extended lead times may occur if we experience other supply constraints caused by natural disasters, pandemics or other events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.",Market Risk
"In addition, geopolitical tensions, such as those involving Taiwan and China, which comprise a significant portion of our revenue and where we have suppliers, contract manufacturers, and assembly partners who are critical to our supply continuity, could have a material adverse impact on us.",Business Risk
"The use of our GPUs for other than that for which they were designed and marketed, including new and unexpected use cases, has impacted and can in the future impact demand for our products, including by leading to inconsistent spikes and drops in demand.",Technology Risk
"For example, a number of years ago, our Gaming GPUs began to be used for digital currency mining, including blockchain-based platforms such as Ethereum.",Technology Risk
"It is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision, the past or current impact of cryptocurrency mining, or forecast the future impact of cryptocurrency mining, on demand for our products.",Technology Risk
"Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including new compute technologies, price changes in cryptocurrencies, government cryptocurrency policies and regulations, new cryptocurrency standards, and changes in the method of verifying blockchain transactions, has impacted and can in the future impact cryptocurrency mining and demand for our products and can further impact our ability to estimate demand for our products.",Market Risk
"Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the recently implemented Ethereum 2.0 merge may decrease the usage of GPUs for Ethereum mining as well as create increased aftermarket sales of our GPUs, which could negatively impact retail prices for our GPUs and reduce demand for our new GPUs.",Technology Risk
"We previously introduced Lite Hash Rate, or LHR, GeForce GPUs with limited Ethereum mining capability and provided CMP products in an effort to address demand from gamers and direct miners to CMP.",Technology Risk
"With the Ethereum 2.0 merge, NVIDIA Ampere and Ada Lovelace architectures no longer include LHR.",Technology Risk
"In addition, our new products or previously sold products may be resold online or on the unauthorized &#8220;gray market,&#8221; which also makes demand forecasting difficult.",Market Risk
Gray market products and reseller marketplaces compete with our new products and distribution channels.,Market Risk
"Additionally, we depend on developers and other third parties to build accelerated computing applications that leverage our platforms.",Technology Risk
We also rely on third-party content providers and publishers to make their content available on our platforms such as GeForce NOW.,Technology Risk
"Failure by developers to build applications that leverage our platforms, or failure by third-party content providers or publishers to make their content available on reasonable terms or at all for use by our customers or end users on our platforms, could adversely affect customer demand.",Technology Risk
"Dependency on third-party suppliers and their technology to manufacture, assemble, test, package or design our products reduces our control over product quantity and quality, manufacturing yields, development, enhancement and product delivery schedules and could harm our business.",Business Risk
We depend on foundries to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment and techniques.,Technology Risk

The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance and our ability to timely execute our business strategies may continue to be difficult to measure and predict.,Business Risk
The impact of COVID-19 can also exacerbate other risks discussed in these risk factors.,Security Risk
"Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate, and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could decline.",Market Risk
Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate due to numerous factors described in these risk factors.,Business Risk
"Therefore, investors should not rely on past comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performance.",Market Risk
"Additional factors that could affect our results of operations include, but are not limited to: 

&#8226; our ability to adjust spending to offset revenue shortfalls due to the multi-year development cycle for some of our products and services; 

&#8226; our ability to comply with our customers&#8217; contractual obligations; 

&#8226; our extended payment term arrangements with certain customers, the inability of some customers to make required payments, our ability to obtain credit insurance for these customers and their extended payment terms, and customer bad debt write-offs; 

&#8226; our vendors' payment requirements; 

&#8226; unanticipated costs associated with environmental liabilities; and 

&#8226; changes in financial accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards.",Financial Risk
Any one or more of the factors discussed above could prevent us from achieving our anticipated future financial results.,Financial Risk
"For example, we have granted and may continue to grant extended payment terms to some customers, particularly during macroeconomic downturns, which could impact our ability to collect payment.",Business Risk
"Our vendors have requested and may continue to ask for shorter payment terms, which may impact our cash flow generation.",Business Risk
These arrangements reduce the cash we have available for general business operations.,Financial Risk
"Failure to meet our expectations or the expectations of our investors or security analysts is likely to cause our stock price to decline, as it has in the past, or experience substantial price volatility.",Security Risk
"Risks Related to Regulatory, Legal, Our Stock and Other Matters 

Our operations could be affected by the complex laws, rules and regulations to which our business is subject, and political and other actions may adversely impact our business.",Business Risk
"We are subject to laws and regulations domestically and worldwide, affecting our operations in areas including, but not limited to, IP ownership and infringement; taxes; import and export requirements and tariffs; anti-corruption, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; business acquisitions; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; data privacy requirements; competition and antitrust; advertising; employment; product regulations; cybersecurity; environmental, health, and safety requirements; the responsible use of AI; climate change; cryptocurrency; and consumer laws.",Legal Risk
"Compliance with such requirements can be onerous and expensive, could impact our competitive position, and may negatively impact our business operations and ability to manufacture and ship our products.",Business Risk
"There can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers, customers or agents will not violate applicable laws or the policies, controls, and procedures that we have designed to help ensure compliance with such laws, and violations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation.",Legal Risk
"Changes to the laws, rules and regulations to which we are subject, or changes to their interpretation and enforcement could lead to materially greater compliance and other costs and/or further restrictions on our ability to manufacture and supply our products and operate our business.",Legal Risk
"For example, we may face increased compliance costs as a result of changes or increases in anti-competition legislation, regulation, administrative rule making, increased focus from regulators on cybersecurity vulnerabilities and risks, and enforcement activity resulting from growing public concern over concentration of economic power in corporations.",Security Risk
"Revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement could also result in increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of or increase to import duties or tariffs, restrictions and controls on imports or exports, or other retaliatory actions, which could have an adverse effect on our business plans or impact the timing of our shipments.",Legal Risk
"Additionally, changes in the public perception of governments in the regions where we operate or plan to operate could negatively impact our business and results of operations.",Business Risk
"Government actions, including trade protection and national security policies of U.S. and foreign government bodies, such as tariffs, import or export regulations, including deemed export restrictions, trade and economic sanctions, decrees, quotas or other trade barriers and restrictions could affect our ability to ship products, provide services to our customers and employees, do business without an export license with entities on the U.S. Department of Commerce&#8217;s U.S.",Business Risk
"Entity List or other U.S. government restricted parties lists (which is expected to change from time to time), and generally fulfill our contractual obligations and have a material adverse effect on our business.",Business Risk
"If we were ever found to have violated export control laws or sanctions of the U.S. or similar applicable non-U.S. laws, even if the violation occurred without our knowledge, we may be subject to various penalties available under the laws, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.",Legal Risk
"For example, in response to the war in Ukraine, the United States and other jurisdictions imposed economic sanctions and export control measures which blocked the passage of our products, services and support into Russia, Belarus, and certain regions of Ukraine.",Business Risk
"In fiscal year 2023, we stopped direct sales to Russia and closed business operations in Russia.",Business Risk
"Concurrently, the war in Ukraine has impacted end customer sales in EMEA and may continue to do so in the future.",Business Risk
"The increasing focus on the strategic importance of AI technologies has already resulted in regulatory restrictions that target products and services capable of enabling or facilitating AI, and may in the future result in additional restrictions impacting some or all of our product and service offerings.",Technology Risk
"Such restrictions could include additional unilateral or multilateral export controls on certain products or technology, including but not limited to AI technologies.",Technology Risk
"As geopolitical tensions have increased, semiconductors associated with AI, including GPUs and associated products, are increasingly the focus of export control restrictions proposed by stakeholders in the U.S. and its allies, and it is likely that additional unilateral or multilateral controls will be adopted.",Technology Risk
"Such controls may be very broad in scope and application, prohibit us from exporting our products to any or all customers in one or more markets, including but not limited to China, and could negatively impact our manufacturing, testing, and warehousing locations and options, or could impose other conditions that limit our ability to serve demand abroad and could negatively and materially impact our business, revenue, and financial results.",Business Risk
"Export controls targeting GPUs and semiconductors associated with AI, which are increasingly likely, would restrict our ability to export our technology, products, or services even though competitors may not be subject to similar restrictions, creating a competitive disadvantage for us and 

negatively impacting our business and financial results.",Business Risk
"Increasing use of economic sanctions may also impact demand for our products or services, negatively impacting our business and financial results.",Business Risk
Additional unilateral or multilateral controls are also likely to include deemed export control limitations that negatively impact the ability of our research and development teams to execute our roadmap or other objectives in a timely manner.,Business Risk
"Additional export restrictions may not only impact our ability to serve overseas markets, but also provoke responses from foreign governments, including China, that negatively impact our supply chain or our ability to provide our products and services to customers in all markets worldwide, which could also substantially reduce our revenue.",Business Risk
"During the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the U.S. government, or USG, announced new export restrictions and export licensing requirements targeting China&#8217;s semiconductor and supercomputing industries.",Technology Risk
"These restrictions impact exports of certain chips, as well as software, hardware, equipment, and technology used to develop, produce, and manufacture certain chips, to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia, and specifically impact our A100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX or any other systems or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits and our A100X.",Technology Risk
"The new license requirements also apply to any future NVIDIA integrated circuit achieving certain peak performance and chip-to-chip I/O performance thresholds, as well as any system or board that includes those circuits.",Legal Risk
"There are also now licensing requirements to export a wide array of products, including networking products, destined for certain end users and for certain end uses in China.",Legal Risk
"We are required to transition certain operations out of China (including Hong Kong), which could be costly and time consuming, and adversely affect our research and development and supply and distribution operations, as well as our revenue, during any such transition period.",Business Risk
"We have engaged with customers in China to provide alternative products not subject to the new license requirements, such as our new A800 offering.",Technology Risk
"To the extent that a customer requires products covered by the new license requirements, we may seek a license for the customer but have no assurance that the USG will grant any exemptions or licenses for any customer, or that the USG will act on them in a timely manner.",Legal Risk
The new requirements may have a disproportionate impact on NVIDIA and may disadvantage NVIDIA against certain of our competitors who sell products that are not subject to the new restrictions or may be able to acquire licenses for their products.,Market Risk
Management of these new license and other requirements is complicated and time consuming.,Legal Risk
"Our results and competitive position may be harmed if customers in China do not want to purchase our alternative product offerings, if customers purchase product from competitors, if customers develop their own internal solution, if we are unable to provide contractual warranty or other extended service obligations, if the USG does not grant licenses in a timely manner or denies licenses to significant customers, or if we incur significant transition costs.",Business Risk
"Additionally, if we are unable to sell our alternative product offerings in China, we may have excess inventory, harming our results.",Business Risk
"Even if the USG grants any requested licenses, the licenses may be temporary or impose burdensome conditions that we cannot or choose not to fulfill.",Legal Risk
"The new requirements may benefit certain of our competitors, as the licensing process will make our pre-sale and post-sale technical support efforts more cumbersome and less certain, and encourage customers in China to pursue alternatives to our products, including semiconductor suppliers based in China, Europe, and Israel.",Market Risk
"Additionally, restrictions imposed by the Chinese government on the duration of gaming activities and access to games may adversely affect our Gaming revenue, and increased oversight of digital platform companies may adversely affect our Data Center revenue.",Business Risk
"Increased scrutiny from shareholders, regulators and others regarding our environmental, social and governance responsibilities could result in additional costs or risks and adversely impact our reputation and willingness of customers and suppliers to do business with us.",Business Risk
"Shareholder advocacy groups, certain investment funds, other market participants, shareholders and customers have placed increased importance on the implications of the social and environmental cost of their investments and these parties, as well as government regulators, have focused increasingly on corporate ESG and sustainability practices and disclosures, including those associated with climate change and human rights.",Market Risk
Stakeholders may not be satisfied with our ESG practices or the speed of their adoption.,Market Risk
"Additionally, our ESG practices, oversight of ESG practices, or disclosure controls may not meet evolving shareholder, regulator, or other industry stakeholder expectations, or we may fail to meet sustainability disclosure or ESG reporting standards.",Market Risk
"We could also incur additional costs and require additional resources to monitor, report, and comply with various ESG practices, choose not to conduct business with potential 

customers, or discontinue or not expand business with existing customers due to our policies.",Business Risk
"These factors may negatively harm our brand, reputation and business activities or expose us to liability.",Business Risk
"Issues relating to the responsible use of our technologies, including AI in our offerings, may result in reputational and financial harm and liability.",Technology Risk
"Concerns relating to the responsible use of new and evolving technologies, such as AI, in our products and services may result in reputational and financial harm and liability, and may cause us to incur costs to resolve such issues.",Technology Risk
We are increasingly building AI capabilities into many of our products and services.,Technology Risk
"AI poses emerging ethical issues and presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption, and therefore our business.",Business Risk
"If we enable or offer solutions that draw controversy due to their perceived or actual impact on society, such as AI solutions that have unintended consequences or are controversial because of their impact on human rights, privacy, employment, or other social, economic, or political issues, or if we are unable to develop effective internal policies and frameworks relating to the responsible development and use of AI models and systems offered through our sales channels, we may experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm or legal liability.",Legal Risk
"Compliance with government regulation in the area of AI ethics may also increase the cost of related research and development, and changes in AI-related regulation could disproportionately impact and disadvantage us and require us to change our business practices, which may negatively impact our financial results.",Technology Risk
Our failure to address concerns relating to the responsible use of AI by us or others could undermine public confidence in AI and slow adoption of AI in our products and services or cause reputational harm.,Technology Risk
Actions to adequately protect our IP rights could result in substantial costs to us and our ability to compete could be harmed if we are unsuccessful or if we are prohibited from making or selling our products.,Legal Risk
"From time to time, we are involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other IP rights violations by us, our employees or parties that we have agreed to indemnify.",Legal Risk
"An unfavorable ruling could include significant damages, invalidation of one or more patents, indemnification of third parties, payment of lost profits, or injunctive relief.",Legal Risk
"Claims that our products or processes infringe the IP rights of others, regardless of their merit, could cause us to incur significant costs to respond to, defend, and resolve such claims, and they may also divert the efforts and attention of management and technical personnel.",Legal Risk
"We may commence legal proceedings to protect our IP rights, which may increase our operating expenses.",Legal Risk
We could be subject to countersuits as a result.,Legal Risk
"If infringement claims are made against us or our products are found to infringe a third party&#8217;s IP, we or one of our indemnitees may have to seek a license to the third party&#8217;s IP rights.",Legal Risk
"If we or one of our indemnitees is unable to obtain such a license, on acceptable terms or at all, we could be subject to substantial liabilities or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of our products.",Legal Risk
"We may also have to make royalty or other payments, or cross license our technology.",Legal Risk
"If these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms, our business could be negatively impacted.",Business Risk
"Furthermore, the indemnification of a customer or other indemnitee may increase our operating expenses and negatively impact our operating results.",Legal Risk
"We rely on patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, licensing arrangements, and the laws of the countries in which we operate to protect our IP.",Legal Risk
Foreign laws may not protect our products or IP rights to the same extent as United States law.,Legal Risk
This makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely.,Technology Risk
"The theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products; as a result, the value of our investment in research and development, product development, and marketing could be reduced.",Business Risk
We also may face risks to our IP if our employees are hired by competitors.,Security Risk
"We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for existing and new innovations and technologies but cannot be certain whether our applications for such protections will be approved, and, if approved, whether they will be enforceable.",Legal Risk
"We are subject to stringent and changing data privacy and security laws, rules, regulations, and other obligations.",Security Risk
"Privacy or security concerns relating to our products and services could damage our reputation, deter current and potential customers, or result in legal or regulatory proceedings and liability.",Security Risk
"We may process sensitive, confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations, industry standards, external and internal policies, contracts and other obligations that govern the processing of such data by us and on our behalf.",Security Risk
"Concerns about our practices or the ultimate use 

of our products and services with regard to the collection, use, retention, security or disclosure of personal information or other privacy-related matters, including for use in AI, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating results.",Business Risk
"The theft, loss, or misuse of personal data in our possession or by one of our partners could result in damage to our reputation, regulatory proceedings, disruption of our business activities or increased security costs and costs related to defending legal claims.",Security Risk
"In the United States, federal, state and local authorities have enacted numerous data privacy and security laws, including for data breach notification, personal data privacy, and consumer protection.",Security Risk
"The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, or CCPA, gives California residents the right to access, delete and opt-out of certain sharing of their personal information, and to receive detailed information about how it is used and shared.",Legal Risk
"The CCPA allows for statutory fines of up to $7,500 per violation and the law created a private right of action for certain data breaches.",Security Risk
"The California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, or CPRA, became operative in 2023, and restricts the use of certain categories of sensitive personal information; further restricts the use of cross-contextual advertising techniques; restricts the retention of personal information; expands the types of data breaches subject to the private right of action; and establishes the California Privacy Protection Agency which can impose administrative fines for noncompliance.",Legal Risk
"Virginia, Colorado, Utah and Connecticut have each passed their own privacy legislation which differ from the CPRA and each become effective in 2023.",Legal Risk
"Similar laws are being considered in several other states, as well as at the federal and local levels.",Legal Risk
"Additionally, several states and localities have enacted measures related to the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning in products and services.",Technology Risk
"If we become subject to additional data privacy laws, the risk of enforcement action against us could increase.",Legal Risk
Worldwide regulatory authorities are also considering and have approved various legislative proposals concerning data protection.,Security Risk
"The European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, and the United Kingdom similarly adopted the U.K. GDPR, governing the strict handling of personal data of persons within the European Economic Area, or EEA, and the United Kingdom, respectively, including its use and protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to access, correct, and delete such data about themselves.",Legal Risk
"If we are found not to comply, we could be subject to penalties of up to &#8364;20 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is greater, and classes of individuals or consumer protection organizations may initiate litigation related to our processing of their personal data.",Legal Risk
"Furthermore, there exists a proposed European regulation related to AI that, if adopted, could impose onerous obligations that may disproportionately impact and disadvantage us and require us to change our business practices.",Technology Risk
"In the ordinary course of business, we may transfer personal data from Europe, China, and other jurisdictions to the United States or other countries.",Technology Risk
Certain jurisdictions have enacted data localization laws and cross-border personal data transfer laws.,Technology Risk
"For example, the GDPR generally restricts the transfer of personal data to countries outside of the EEA.",Legal Risk
"The European Commission released a set of &#8220;Standard Contractual Clauses&#8221; designed for entities to validly transfer personal data out of the EEA to jurisdictions that the European Commission has not found to provide an adequate level of protection, including the United States.",Legal Risk
"While the European Union and United States governments have recently announced an agreement in principle on a new bilateral cross-border transfer mechanism, it is uncertain whether this agreement will be overturned in court like the previous two European Union-United States bilateral cross-border transfer agreements.",Legal Risk
"These mechanisms are subject to legal challenges, and there is no assurance that we can satisfy or rely on these measures to lawfully transfer personal data to the United States.",Legal Risk
"Other jurisdictions have enacted or are considering similar cross-border personal data transfer laws and local personal data residency laws, any of which would increase the cost and complexity of doing business and could result in fines from regulators.",Legal Risk
"For example, China law imposes various requirements relating to data processing and data localization.",Legal Risk
"Data broadly defined as important under China law, including personal data, may not be transferable outside of China without prior assessment and approval by the Cyberspace Administration of China, or CAC.",Legal Risk
"Compliance with these requirements, including CAC assessments and any deemed failures of such assessments, could cause us to incur liability, prevent us from using data collected in China, or impact our ability to transfer data outside of China.",Legal Risk
"The inability to import personal data to the United States could significantly and negatively impact our business operations, limit our ability to collaborate with parties that are subject to European, China, and other data privacy and security laws, or require us to increase our personal data processing capabilities in Europe and/or elsewhere at significant expense.",Business Risk
"Some European regulators have prevented companies from transferring personal data out of Europe for allegedly violating the GDPR&#8217;s cross-border data transfer limitations, which could negatively impact our business.",Business Risk
"We may also be bound by contractual obligations related to data privacy and security, and our efforts to comply with such obligations may not be successful or may be claimed to be non-compliant.",Security Risk
"For example, 

certain privacy laws, such as the GDPR and the CCPA, require our customers to impose specific contractual restrictions on their service providers.",Legal Risk
"We sometimes host personal data in collaboration with our customers, and if a breach exposed or altered that personal data, it could harm those customer relationships and subject us to litigation, regulatory action, or fines.",Security Risk
"We may publish privacy policies, marketing materials and other statements, such as compliance with certain certifications or self-regulatory principles, regarding data privacy and security.",Security Risk
"If these policies, materials or statements are found to be deficient, lacking in transparency, deceptive, unfair, or misrepresentative of our practices, we may be subject to investigation, enforcement actions by regulators or other adverse consequences.",Legal Risk
Data protection laws around the world are quickly changing and may be interpreted and applied in an increasingly stringent fashion and in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices.,Legal Risk
"These obligations may necessitate changes to our information technologies, systems, and practices and to those of any third parties that process personal data on our behalf.",Technology Risk
"Despite our efforts, we or third parties upon whom we rely may fail to comply with such obligations.",Legal Risk
"If we fail, or are perceived to have failed, to address or comply with data privacy and security obligations, we could face significant consequences, including but not limited to, government enforcement actions, litigation, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight, bans on processing personal data and orders to destroy or not use personal data.",Security Risk

We have exposure to additional tax liabilities and our operating results may be adversely impacted by higher than expected tax rates and other tax-related factors.,Business Risk
"We are subject to complex income tax laws and regulations, as well as non-income-based taxes, in various jurisdictions.",Legal Risk
Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities.,Legal Risk
We are regularly under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions.,Legal Risk
"For example, we are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for our fiscal years 2018 and 2019 and undergoing tax audits in Germany, Israel and India.",Business Risk
"Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, any adverse outcome could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of non-income taxes imposed on our business, and harm our financial position, results of operations, net income, and cash flows.",Business Risk
"Further, changes in tax laws may materially impact our results of operations, or the way we conduct our business.",Business Risk
"These include changes to U.S. tax laws and regulations, such as the Inflation Reduction Act, which implements a 15% minimum tax on book income and a 1% excise tax on net stock repurchases and parts of which became effective for us in fiscal year 2023.",General Risk
"It is possible that these changes, or other tax law changes, could increase our future tax liability or cause other adverse impacts.",Business Risk
"Most of our income is taxable in the United States, with a significant portion qualifying for preferential treatment as foreign-derived intangible income, or FDII.",Financial Risk
"If U.S. tax rates increase or the FDII deduction is reduced, our provision for income taxes, results of operations, net income and cash flows would be adversely affected.",Business Risk
"In addition, changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting project undertaken by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, or OECD.",Legal Risk
"The OECD recommended changes to long-standing tax principles and continues to develop new proposals, including allocating greater taxing rights to countries where customers are located and establishing a minimum tax on global income.",General Risk
"These changes, as adopted by countries, may increase tax uncertainty and adversely affect our provision for income taxes, results of operations and financial condition.",Business Risk
"Our future effective tax rate may also be affected by a variety of factors, including changes in our business or statutory rates, the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, available tax incentives, credits and deductions, the expiration of statute of limitations and settlements of tax audits, changes in accounting principles, adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns, increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and deferred tax valuation allowances, changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations, the impact of accounting for business combinations, as well as changes in the domestic or international organization of our business and structure.",Financial Risk
"Furthermore, the tax effects of accounting for stock-based compensation and volatility in our stock price may significantly impact our effective tax rate in the period in which they occur.",Financial Risk
"A decline in our stock price may result in reduced future tax benefits from stock-based compensation, increase our effective tax rate, and adversely affect our financial results.",Financial Risk
"Our business is exposed to the risks associated with litigation, investigations and regulatory proceedings.",Business Risk
"We currently and will likely continue to face legal, administrative and regulatory proceedings, claims, demands and/or investigations involving shareholder, consumer, competition and/or other issues relating to 

our business.",Legal Risk
"For example, we are defending on appeal the dismissal of a securities class action lawsuit from multiple shareholders asserting claims that we and certain of our officers made false and/or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand in 2017 and 2018.",Legal Risk
"Litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, including monetary damages or fines, or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products, engaging in certain business practices, or requiring other remedies, such as compulsory licensing of patents.",Legal Risk
An unfavorable outcome or settlement may result in a material adverse impact.,Financial Risk
"Regardless of the outcome, litigation can be costly, time-consuming, and disruptive to our operations.",Legal Risk
"Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position and cash flows from operations, and prevent us from implementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligations.",Financial Risk
"As of January 29, 2023, we had outstanding a total of $11 billion in notes due by 2060.",Financial Risk
"As each series of senior notes matures, unless redeemed or repurchased, we must repay or refinance the notes.",Financial Risk
"If we decide to refinance, we may receive less favorable terms, or we may be unable to refinance at all, which may adversely affect our financial condition.",Financial Risk
We also have a $575 million commercial paper program.,Financial Risk
"Maintenance of our current and future indebtedness and contractual restrictions could cause us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations towards debt service obligations and principal repayments; increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions; limit our flexibility regarding changes in our business and our industry; impair our ability to obtain future financing; and restrict our ability to grant liens on property, enter into certain mergers, dispose of our assets, or materially change our business.",Financial Risk
Our ability to comply with the covenants in our indenture may be affected by events beyond our control.,Legal Risk
"If we breach any of the covenants without a waiver from the note holders or lenders, then any outstanding indebtedness may be declared immediately due and payable.",Financial Risk
"Changes to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of our securities, restrict our ability to obtain future financing and affect the terms of any such financing.",Financial Risk
"Delaware law and our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and agreement with Microsoft could delay or prevent a change in control.",Legal Risk
"The anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control.",Legal Risk
Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding stock.,Legal Risk
"These provisions include the ability of our Board of Directors to create and issue preferred stock, change the number of directors, and to make, amend or repeal our bylaws without prior shareholder approval; the inability of our shareholders to act by written consent or call special meetings; advance notice requirements for director nominations and shareholder proposals; and a super-majority voting requirement to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws.",Legal Risk
"Under our agreement with Microsoft for the Xbox, if someone makes an offer to purchase at least 30% of our outstanding common stock, Microsoft may have first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock.",Legal Risk

"&#8226; Social and environmental regulations, policies and provisions, as well as customer and investor demands, may make our supply chain more complex and may adversely affect our relationships with customers and investors.",Business Risk
&#8226; The average selling prices of semiconductor products in our markets have often decreased rapidly and may do so in the future.,Market Risk
&#8226; Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could result in losses.,Market Risk
"Risks Relating to Taxes 

&#8226; Changes in tax legislation or policies could materially impact our financial position and results of operations.",Business Risk
&#8226; Our corporate income taxes could significantly increase if we are unable to maintain our tax concessions or if our assumptions and interpretations regarding tax laws and concessions prove to be incorrect.,Business Risk
"&#8226; Our income taxes and overall cash tax costs are affected by a number of factors that could materially, adversely affect financial results.",Financial Risk
"Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness 

&#8226; Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and our ability to execute our business strategy.",Financial Risk
&#8226; The instruments governing our indebtedness impose certain restrictions on our business.,Financial Risk
"&#8226; Servicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flows from our business to pay our substantial debt.",Financial Risk
"Risks Relating to Owning Our Common Stock 

&#8226; Volatility of our stock price could result in substantial losses for our investors as well as class action litigation against us and our management.",Market Risk
&#8226; The amount and frequency of our stock repurchases may fluctuate.,Market Risk
&#8226; A substantial amount of our stock is held by a small number of large investors.,Market Risk
&#8226; There can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends.,Business Risk
"For a more complete discussion of the material risks facing our business, see below.",Business Risk
"Risks Related to Our Business 

Adverse global economic conditions could have a negative effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition and liquidity.",Business Risk
"A general slowdown in the global economy, including a recession, or in a particular region or industry, an increase in trade tensions with U.S. trading partners, inflation or a tightening of the credit markets could negatively impact our business, financial condition and liquidity.",General Risk
"Adverse global economic conditions have from time to time caused or exacerbated significant slowdowns in the industries and markets in which we operate, which have adversely affected our business and results of operations.",Business Risk
"Macroeconomic weakness and uncertainty also make it more difficult for us to accurately forecast revenue, gross margin and expenses, and may make it more difficult to raise or refinance debt.",Financial Risk
An escalation of trade tensions between the U.S. and China has resulted in trade restrictions and increased tariffs that harm our ability to participate in Chinese markets or compete effectively with Chinese companies.,Business Risk
"Sustained uncertainty about, or worsening of, current global economic conditions and further escalation of trade tensions between the U.S. and its trading partners, especially China, and possible 

decoupling of the U.S. and China economies, could result in a global economic slowdown and long-term changes to global trade.",Business Risk
"Such events may also (i) cause our customers and consumers to reduce, delay or forgo technology spending, (ii) result in customers sourcing products from other suppliers not subject to such restrictions or tariffs, (iii) lead to the insolvency or consolidation of key suppliers and customers, and (iv) intensify pricing pressures.",Technology Risk
"Any or all of these factors could negatively affect demand for our products and our business, financial condition and results of operations.",Business Risk
We operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry.,Technology Risk
"The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by price erosion, wide fluctuations in product supply and demand, constant and rapid technological change, evolving technical standards, frequent new product introductions, and short product life cycles (for semiconductors and for many of the end products in which they are used).",Market Risk
"From time to time, these factors, together with changes in general economic conditions, cause significant upturns and downturns in the industry in general, and in our business in particular.",Business Risk
The industry recently experienced a significant upturn due to the supply imbalance that resulted in record profitability and increases in average selling prices.,Market Risk
"It is possible that this recent industry up-cycle will be followed by a downturn, and historically, such down-cycles have been characterized by diminished demand for end-user products, high inventory levels and periods of inventory adjustment, under-utilization of manufacturing capacity, changes in revenue mix, accelerated erosion of average selling prices and elimination of expedite fees leading to reduced profitability and a decline in our stock price.",Market Risk
The Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors for America Act could also result in an increase in supply leading to excess inventory and a decrease in average selling prices.,Market Risk
We expect our business to continue to be subject to cyclical downturns even when overall economic conditions are relatively stable.,Business Risk
"If we cannot offset industry or market downturns, our net revenue may decline and our financial condition and results of operations may suffer.",Business Risk
The majority of our sales come from a small number of customers and a reduction in demand or loss of one or more of our significant customers may adversely affect our business.,Business Risk
"We are dependent on a small number of end customers, OEMs, their respective contract manufacturers (&#8220;CMs&#8221;), and certain distributors for a majority of our business and revenue.",Business Risk
"For fiscal year 2022, sales to distributors accounted for 56% of our net revenue.",Market Risk
"We believe aggregate sales, through all channels, to Apple and our top five end customers, accounted for approximately 20% and 35% of our net revenue for fiscal year 2022, respectively.",Market Risk
"This customer concentration increases the risk of quarterly fluctuations in our operating results and our sensitivity to any material, adverse developments experienced by our significant customers.",Business Risk
Our semiconductor customers are not generally required to purchase specific quantities of products.,General Risk
"Even when customers agree to source an agreed portion of their product needs from us, such arrangements often include pricing schedules or methodologies that apply regardless of the volume of products purchased, and those customers may not purchase the amount of product we expect.",Business Risk
"As a result, we may not generate the amount of revenue or achieve the level of profitability we expect under such arrangements.",Business Risk
"Moreover, our top customers&#8217; purchasing power has, in some cases, given them the ability to make greater demands on us with regard to pricing and contractual terms in general.",Market Risk
"We expect this trend to continue, which may adversely affect our gross margin on certain products and, should we fail to perform under these arrangements, we could also be liable for significant monetary damages.",Business Risk
"The loss of, or any substantial reduction in sales to, any of our top customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.",Business Risk
"Dependence on contract manufacturing and suppliers of critical components within our supply chain may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market, damage our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations.",Business Risk
"We operate a primarily outsourced manufacturing business model that principally utilizes CMs, such as third-party wafer foundries and module assembly and test capabilities.",Market Risk
"Our semiconductor products require wafer manufacturers with state-of-the-art fabrication equipment and techniques, and most of our products are designed to be manufactured in a specific process, typically at one particular fab or foundry, either our own or with a particular CM.",Market Risk
"We depend on our CMs to allocate sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality at acceptable yields, and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis.",Business Risk
We do not generally have long-term capacity commitments with our CMs and substantially all of our manufacturing services are on a purchase order basis with no minimum quantities.,General Risk
"Further, our CMs may fail to timely develop new, advanced manufacturing processes, including transitions to smaller geometry process technologies or, from time to time, will cease to, or will become unable to, manufacture a component for us.",Technology Risk
"As lead times to identify, qualify and establish reliable production at acceptable yields with a new CM is typically lengthy, there is often no readily available alternative source and there may be other constraints on our ability to change CMs.",Technology Risk
"In addition, qualifying new CMs is often expensive, and they may not produce products as cost-effectively as our current suppliers.",Technology Risk
"TSMC, one of our CMs, manufactured approximately 90% of the wafers manufactured by our CMs during fiscal year 2022.",Market Risk
We believe our wafer requirements represent a meaningful portion of TSMC&#8217;s total production capacity.,Technology Risk
"However, TSMC also fabricates wafers for other companies, including some of our competitors, and could choose or be required to prioritize capacity for other customers or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us on short notice.",Technology Risk
"In addition, TSMC has, and may in the future, raise their prices to us.",Technology Risk
"If any of the foregoing circumstances occur, we may be unable to meet our customer demand, or to the same extent as our competitors, fail to meet our contractual obligations or forgo revenue opportunities.",Business Risk
"This has in the past damaged, and may in the future damage our relationships with our customers.",Business Risk
"This could also result in litigation for alleged failure to meet our obligations, payment of significant damages, and our net revenue could decline, adversely affecting our business, financial condition, results of operations and gross margin.",Legal Risk
"Further, any substantial disruption in the contract manufacturing services that we utilize, including TSMC&#8217;s supply of wafers to us, as a result of a natural disaster, climate change, water shortages, political unrest, military conflicts, geopolitical turmoil, trade tensions, government orders, medical epidemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, economic instability, equipment failure or other cause, could materially harm our business, customer relationships and results of operations.",Business Risk
We purchase a significant amount of the materials used in our products from a limited number of suppliers.,Market Risk
"Our manufacturing processes and those of our CMs rely on many materials, including silicon, GaAs and InP wafers, copper lead frames, precious and rare earth metals, mold compound, ceramic packages and various chemicals and gases.",Technology Risk
"During fiscal year 2022, we purchased approximately two-thirds of our manufacturing materials from five materials providers, some of which are single source suppliers.",Market Risk
"As certain materials are highly specialized, the lead time needed to identify and qualify a new supplier is typically lengthy and there is often no readily available alternative source.",Market Risk
We do not generally have long-term contracts with our materials providers and substantially all of our purchases are on a purchase order basis.,Market Risk
"Suppliers may extend lead times, limit supplies, place products on allocation or increase prices due to commodity price increases, capacity constraints, inflation, or other factors, any of which could lead to interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry.",Market Risk
"For example, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced some supply constraints and increases in prices, including with respect to wafers and substrates.",Market Risk
"Additionally, the supply of these materials may be negatively impacted by increased trade tensions between the U.S. and its trading partners, particularly China.",Business Risk
"The supply constraints have had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on our customer relationships.",Business Risk
"Further, continued supply constraints for these or any other reasons could result in loss of revenue opportunities and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.",Business Risk
"Our business is subject to various governmental regulations, and compliance with these regulations may cause us to incur significant expense.",Business Risk
"If we fail to maintain compliance with applicable regulations, we may be forced to cease the manufacture and distribution of certain products, and we could be subject to administrative proceedings and civil or criminal penalties.",Legal Risk
"Our business is subject to various domestic and international laws and other legal requirements, including anti-competition and import/export regulations, such as the U.S.",Legal Risk
"Export Administration Regulations, and applicable executive orders.",Legal Risk
"These laws, regulations and orders are complex, may change frequently and with limited notice, and have generally and may continue to become more stringent over time.",Legal Risk
"We may be required to incur significant expense to comply with, or to remedy violations of, these regulations.",Legal Risk
"In addition, if our customers fail to comply with these regulations, we may be required to suspend sales to these customers, which could damage our reputation and negatively impact our results of operations.",Business Risk
"The U.S. government may also add companies to its restricted entity list and/or technologies to its list of prohibited exports to specific countries, which have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our ability to sell our products and our revenue.",Business Risk
"For example, Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., one of our customers, is subject to certain U.S. export restrictions, which has required us to suspend sales to Huawei until we obtain licenses from the U.S. Department of Commerce.",Technology Risk
We may be unable to obtain or maintain the necessary licenses to allow us to export products to them.,Legal Risk
"These restrictive governmental actions and any similar measures that may be imposed on U.S. companies by other governments, especially in light of ongoing trade tensions with China, will likely limit or prevent us from doing business with certain of our customers or suppliers and harm our ability to compete effectively or otherwise negatively affect our ability to sell our products, and adversely affect our business and results of operations.",Business Risk
"Our products and operations are also subject to regulation by U.S. and non-U.S. regulatory agencies, such as the FTC.",Market Risk
"From time to time, we may also be involved or required to participate in regulatory investigations or inquiries, such as the ongoing investigation by the Korean Fair Trade Commission into certain of our contracting and business practices, which may evolve into legal or other administrative proceedings.",Legal Risk
"Growing public concern over concentration of economic power in corporations is likely to result in increased anti-competition legislation, regulation, administrative rule making, and enforcement activity.",Legal Risk
"Involvement in regulatory investigations or inquiries, can be costly, lengthy, complex and time consuming, diverting the attention and energies of our management and technical personnel.",Legal Risk
"If any pending or future governmental investigations result in an unfavorable resolution, we could be required to cease the manufacture and sale of the subject products or technology, pay fines or disgorge profits or other payments, and/or cease certain conduct and/or modify our contracting or business practices, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",Legal Risk
"We may be obligated to indemnify our current or former directors or employees, or former directors or employees of companies that we have acquired, in connection with regulatory investigations.",Legal Risk
"These liabilities could be substantial and may include, among other things, the cost of government, law enforcement or regulatory investigations and civil or criminal fines and penalties.",Legal Risk
"In addition, the manufacture and distribution of our semiconductors must comply with various laws and adapt to changes in regulatory requirements as they occur.",Legal Risk
"For example, if a country in which our products are manufactured or sold sets technical standards that are not widely shared, it may require us to stop distributing our products commercially until they comply with such new standards, lead certain of our customers to suspend imports of their products into that country, require manufacturers in that country to manufacture products with different technical standards and disrupt cross-border manufacturing relationships, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",Business Risk
"If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could also be required to pay civil penalties or face criminal prosecution.",Legal Risk
"Global political and economic conditions and other factors related to our international operations could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.",Business Risk
"A majority of our products are produced, sourced and sold internationally and our international revenue represents a significant percentage of our overall revenue.",Market Risk
"In addition, as of October 30, 2022, nearly 49% of our employees were located outside the U.S.",Security Risk
"Multiple factors relating to our international operations and to particular countries in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",Business Risk
"These factors include: 

&#8226; changes in political, regulatory, legal or economic conditions or geopolitical turmoil (including China-Taiwan relations), including terrorism, war or political or military coups, state-sponsored or politically motivated cyber-attacks, or civil disturbances or political instability foreign and domestic; 

&#8226; restrictive governmental actions, such as restrictions on the transfer or repatriation of funds and foreign investments, data privacy regulations, imposition of climate change regulations, and trade protection measures, including increasing protectionism, import/export restrictions (including with regards to advanced technologies), import/export duties and quotas, trade sanctions and customs duties and tariffs, all of which have increased in recent years; 

&#8226; difficulty in obtaining product distribution and support, and transportation delays; 

&#8226; potential inability to localize software products; 

&#8226; difficulty in conducting due diligence with respect to business partners; 

&#8226; public health or safety concerns, medical epidemics or pandemics, such as COVID-19, and other natural- or man-made disasters; 

&#8226; nationalization of businesses and expropriation of assets; and 

&#8226; changes in U.S. and foreign tax laws.",Business Risk
A significant legal risk associated with conducting business internationally is compliance with the various and differing laws and regulations of the many countries in which we do business.,Legal Risk
"In addition, the laws in various countries are constantly evolving and may, in some cases, conflict with each other.",Legal Risk
"Although our policies prohibit us, our employees and our agents from engaging in unethical business practices, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, distributors or other agents will refrain from acting in violation of our related anti-corruption or other policies and procedures.",General Risk
Any such violation could have a material adverse effect on our business.,Business Risk
"The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted normal business activity, which has impacted how we operate our business.",Business Risk
"The COVID-19 pandemic and the efforts to control it disrupted, and reduced the efficiency of, normal business activities in much of the world.",Business Risk
"We experienced some disruption to parts of our global semiconductor supply chain, including procuring necessary components and inputs, such as wafers and substrates, in a timely fashion, with suppliers increasing lead times or placing products on allocation.",Business Risk
"As a result of these supply chain disruptions, we increased customer order lead times and placed some products on allocation.",Business Risk
We are also largely building semiconductor products to order and this has limited and may continue to limit our ability to fulfill orders and satisfy all of the demand for our products.,Technology Risk
"The pandemic resulted in authorities around the world implementing numerous unprecedented measures, such as travel restrictions quarantines, shelter-in-place order, and factory and office shutdowns, that impacted our workforce and 

operations, and those of our customers, CMs, suppliers and logistics providers.",Business Risk
"In addition, disruptions to commercial transportation infrastructure impacted delivery times for materials and components to our facilities, transfers of our products to our key suppliers and, in some cases, our ability to timely ship our products to customers.",Business Risk
"This resulted in significant logistical challenges and product delays, which could recur in the event of any future closures of, or periods of reduced operations at, our warehouse or the facilities of our suppliers and providers.",Business Risk
"In response to the pandemic, we have taken extensive measures to protect the health and safety of our employees and contractors at our facilities.",Security Risk
"However, existing or new precautionary measures or modifications in our business practices and policies, may negatively impact our business or operations, especially if the spread of COVID-19 (including any variants) worsens significantly.",Business Risk
"In addition, any actions we take may not be sufficient to mitigate the risk of infection and could result in a significant number of COVID-19-related claims.",Security Risk
"If a significant number of our employees, or employees and third parties performing key functions, including our Chief Executive Officer and members of our Board of Directors, become ill, our business may be further adversely impacted.",Business Risk
"In addition, changes to state workers&#8217; compensation laws, such as those in California, may increase our potential liability for such claims.",Legal Risk
"See also our risk factor &#8220; If we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel, especially our engineering and technical personnel, we may not be able to execute our business strategy effectively.",Business Risk
"&#8221; 

The degree to which the pandemic ultimately impacts our business and results of operations will depend on future developments beyond our control, including the extent of actions to contain the virus (including any variants), availability and efficacy of the vaccines or other treatments, public acceptance of the vaccines (including boosters), and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions resume.",Business Risk
"We are subject to risks associated with our distributors and other channel partners, including product inventory levels and product sell-through.",Business Risk
We sell our products through a direct sales force and a select network of distributors and other channel partners globally.,Market Risk
"Sales to distributors accounted for 56% of our net revenue in the fiscal year ended October 30, 2022 and are subject to a number of risks, including: 

&#8226; fluctuations in demand based on our distributors&#8217; product inventory levels and end customer demand; 

&#8226; our distributors and other channel partners are generally not subject to minimum sales requirements or any obligation to market our products to their customers; 

&#8226; our distributors and other channel partners agreements are generally nonexclusive and may be terminated at any time without cause; 

&#8226; our lack of control over the timing of delivery of our products to end customers; and 

&#8226; our distributors and other channel partners may market and distribute competing products and may place greater emphasis on the sale of these products.",Business Risk
"In addition, we are selling our semiconductor products through an increasingly limited number of distributors, which exposes us to additional customer concentration and related credit risks.",Technology Risk
We do not always have a direct relationship with the end customers of our products.,Market Risk
"As a result, our semiconductor products may be used in applications for which they were not necessarily designed or tested, including, for example, medical devices, and they may not perform as anticipated in such applications.",Technology Risk
"In such event, failure of even a small number of parts could result in significant liabilities to us, damage our reputation and harm our business and results of operations.",Business Risk
Our business would be adversely affected by the departure of existing members of our senior management team.,Business Risk
"Our success depends, in large part, on the continued contributions of our senior management team, and in particular, the services of Hock E. Tan, our President and Chief Executive Officer.",Legal Risk
Effective succession planning is also important for our long-term success.,General Risk
Failure to ensure effective transfers of knowledge and smooth transitions involving senior management could hinder our strategic planning and execution.,Business Risk
None of our senior management is bound by written employment contracts.,General Risk
"In addition, we do not currently maintain key person life insurance covering our senior management.",Financial Risk
The loss of any of our senior management could harm our ability to implement our business strategy and respond to the rapidly changing market conditions in which we operate.,Business Risk
"If we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel, especially our engineering and technical personnel, we may not be able to execute our business strategy effectively.",Business Risk
"Our future success depends on our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.",General Risk
"As the source of our technological and product innovations, our engineering and technical personnel (including cyber security experts) are a significant asset.",Security Risk
"Competition for these employees is significant in many areas of the world in which we operate, particularly 

in Silicon Valley and Southeast Asia where qualified engineers are in high demand.",Market Risk
"In addition, current or future immigration laws may make it more difficult to hire or retain qualified engineers, further limiting the pool of available talent.",Legal Risk
We believe equity awards provide a powerful long-term retention incentive and have historically granted these awards to the substantial majority of our employees.,Market Risk
"However, the amendments to our 2012 Stock Incentive Plan approved by our stockholders in 2021 significantly reduced the number of shares available for equity awards.",Security Risk
"As a result, we may need to change our current equity granting philosophy, which could impair our efforts to attract and retain necessary personnel.",Business Risk
"Any inability to retain, attract or motivate such personnel and provide competitive employment benefits could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",Business Risk
"The failure to complete our acquisition of VMware, Inc. may adversely affect our business and our stock price.",Business Risk
"Consummation of the VMware Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions, including (i) the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of 1976 and clearance under the antitrust laws of the European Union and certain other jurisdictions, (ii) the receipt by VMware of a tax opinion regarding the U.S. federal income tax treatment of certain aspects of the VMware Merger, (iii) the absence of certain orders or laws preventing consummation of the VMware Merger, (iv) authorization for listing additional shares of Broadcom common stock on Nasdaq, and (v) the absence of a material adverse effect with respect to either us or VMware.",Legal Risk
There can be no assurance that these or other closing conditions will be satisfied in a timely manner or at all.,Market Risk
"Any delay in completing the acquisition could cause us not to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits when expected, if at all.",Business Risk
"If the VMware Merger is not completed, our stock price could decline to the extent it reflects an assumption that we will complete the acquisition.",Market Risk
"Furthermore, if the VMware Merger is not completed, we may suffer other consequences that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and stock price, including incurring significant acquisition costs that we would be unable to recover, negative publicity and a negative impression of us in the investment community.",Business Risk
"Additionally, under certain specified circumstances, including the termination by either us or VMware because certain required regulatory clearances are not obtained, upon termination we would be required to pay VMware a termination fee of $1.5 billion.",Legal Risk
Failure to realize the benefits expected from the VMware Merger could adversely affect the value of our common stock.,Market Risk
"Although we expect significant benefits to result from the VMware Merger, there can be no assurance that we will actually realize any of them, or realize them within the anticipated timeframe.",Technology Risk
"Achieving these benefits will depend, in part, on our ability to integrate VMware's business successfully and efficiently.",Technology Risk
"The challenges involved in this integration, which will be complex and time consuming, include the following: 

&#8226; preserving customer and other important relationships of VMware and attracting new business and operational relationships; 

&#8226; integrating financial forecasting and controls, procedures and reporting cycles; 

&#8226; consolidating and integrating corporate, information technology, finance and administrative infrastructures; 

&#8226; coordinating sales and marketing efforts to effectively position our capabilities; 

&#8226; coordinating and integrating operations in countries in which we have not previously operated; and 

&#8226; integrating employees and related HR systems and benefits, maintaining employee morale and retaining key employees.",Business Risk
"If we do not successfully manage these issues and the other challenges inherent in integrating an acquired business, then we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the VMware Merger on our anticipated timeframe or at all and our revenue, expenses, operating results, financial condition and stock price could be materially adversely affected.",Business Risk
"The successful integration of the VMware business will require significant management attention both before and after the completion of the VMware Merger, and may divert the attention of management from our business and operational issues.",Technology Risk
"We may pursue acquisitions, investments, joint ventures and dispositions, which could adversely affect our results of operations.",Business Risk
"Our growth strategy includes acquiring or investing in businesses that offer complementary products, services and technologies, or enhance our market coverage or technological capabilities.",Market Risk
"Any acquisitions we may undertake, including the VMware Merger, and their integration involve risks and uncertainties, such as: 

&#8226; unexpected delays, challenges and related expenses, and disruption of our business; 

&#8226; diversion of management&#8217;s attention from daily operations and the pursuit of other opportunities; 

&#8226; incurring significant restructuring charges and amortization expense, assuming liabilities (some of which may be unexpected) and ongoing or new lawsuits, potential impairment of acquired goodwill and other intangible assets, and increasing our expenses and working capital requirements; 

&#8226; the potential for deficiencies in internal controls at the acquired business, as well as implementing our own management information systems, operating systems and internal controls for the acquired operations; 

&#8226; our due diligence process may fail to identify significant issues with the acquired business&#8217; products, financial disclosures, accounting practices, legal, tax and other contingencies, compliance with local laws and regulations (and interpretations thereof) in the U.S. and multiple international jurisdictions; 

&#8226; additional acquisition-related debt, which could increase our leverage and potentially negatively affect our credit ratings resulting in more restrictive borrowing terms or increased borrowing costs thereby limiting our ability to borrow; 

&#8226; dilution of stock ownership of existing stockholders; 

&#8226; difficulties integrating the acquired business or company and in managing and retaining acquired employees, vendors and customers; and 

&#8226; inaccuracies in our original estimates and assumptions used to assess a transaction, which may result in us not realizing the expected financial or strategic benefits of any such transaction.",Business Risk
"In addition, current and future changes to the U.S. and foreign regulatory approval process and requirements related to acquisitions, including the VMware Merger, may cause approvals to take longer than anticipated, not be forthcoming or contain burdensome conditions, which may prevent the transaction or jeopardize, delay or reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction, and impede the execution of our business strategy.",Business Risk
"From time to time, we may also seek to divest or wind down portions of our business, either acquired or otherwise, or we may exit minority investments, any of which could materially affect our cash flows and results of operations.",Business Risk
"Such dispositions involve risks and uncertainties, including our ability to sell such businesses on terms acceptable to us, or at all, disruption to other parts of our business, potential loss of employees or customers, or exposure to unanticipated liabilities or ongoing obligations to us following any such dispositions.",Business Risk
"In addition, dispositions may include the transfer of technology and/or the licensing of certain IP rights to third-party purchasers, which could limit our ability to utilize such IP rights or assert these rights against such third-party purchasers or other third parties.",Legal Risk
"We may be involved in legal proceedings, including IP, securities litigation, and employee-related claims, which could, among other things, divert efforts of management and result in significant expense and loss of our IP rights.",Legal Risk
"We are often involved in legal proceedings, including cases involving our IP rights and those of others, commercial matters, acquisition-related suits, securities class action suits, employee-related claims and other actions.",Legal Risk
"Litigation or settlement of such actions, regardless of their merit, can be costly, lengthy, complex and time consuming, diverting the attention and energies of our management and technical personnel.",Legal Risk
"The industries in which we operate are characterized by companies holding large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets and by the vigorous pursuit, protection and enforcement of IP rights, including actions by patent-holding companies that do not make or sell products.",Legal Risk
"From time to time, third parties assert against us and our customers and distributors their IP rights to technologies that are important to our business.",Legal Risk
"For example, in August 2020 judgment was entered against Broadcom and Apple for infringement of certain patents and California Institute of Technology was awarded past damages of $270.2 million from Broadcom and $837.8 million from Apple, for which Apple is seeking indemnification from Broadcom.",Legal Risk
"Although the appellate court recently vacated these damages and ordered a new trial, there are no assurances that we will be successful or what, if any, damages we will be required to pay.",Legal Risk
"Many of our customer agreements, and in some cases our asset sale agreements, and/or the laws of certain jurisdictions may require us to indemnify our customers or purchasers for third-party IP infringement claims, including costs to defend those claims, and payment of damages in the case of adverse rulings.",Legal Risk
"However, our CMs and suppliers may or may not be required to indemnify us should we or our customers be subject to such third-party claims.",Legal Risk
Claims of this sort could also harm our relationships with our customers and might deter future customers from doing business with us.,Business Risk
"If any pending or future proceedings result in an adverse outcome, we could be required to: 

&#8226; cease the manufacture, use or sale of the infringing products, processes or technology and/or make changes to our processes or products; 

&#8226; pay substantial damages for past, present and future use of the infringing technology, including up to treble damages if willful infringement is found; 

&#8226; expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology; 

&#8226; license technology from the third-party claiming infringement, which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all; 

&#8226; enter into cross-licenses with our competitors, which could weaken our overall IP portfolio and our ability to compete in particular product categories; 

&#8226; pay substantial damages to our direct or end customers to discontinue use or replace infringing technology with non-infringing technology; or 

&#8226; relinquish IP rights associated with one or more of our patent claims.",Legal Risk
"Any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",Financial Risk
"In addition, we may be obligated to indemnify our current or former directors or employees, or former directors or employees of companies that we have acquired, in connection with such litigation.",Legal Risk
"These liabilities could be substantial and may include, among other things, the cost of defending lawsuits against these individuals, as well as stockholder derivative suits; civil or criminal fines and penalties; legal and other expenses; and expenses associated with the remedial measure, if any, which may be imposed.",Legal Risk
Our operating results are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations.,Business Risk
Our operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future.,Business Risk
"These fluctuations may occur on a quarterly and annual basis and are due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control.",Financial Risk
"In addition to many of the risks described elsewhere in this &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; section, these factors include, among others: 

&#8226; the timing of launches by our customers of new product in which our products are included and changes in end-user demand for our customers&#8217; the products; 

&#8226; fluctuations in the levels of component or product inventories held by our customers; 

&#8226; the shift to cloud-based IT solutions and services, such as hyperscale computing, which may adversely affect the timing and volume of sales of our products for use in traditional enterprise data centers; 

&#8226; the timing of new software contracts and renewals, as well as the timing of any terminations of software contracts that require us to refund to customers any pre-paid amounts under the contract; 

&#8226; our ability to timely develop, introduce and market new products and technologies; 

&#8226; the timing and extent of our software license and subscription revenue, and other non-product revenue; 

&#8226; new product announcements and introductions by us or our competitors; 

&#8226; seasonality or other fluctuations in demand in our markets; 

&#8226; timing and amount of research and development and related new product expenditures, and the timing of receipt of any research and development grant monies; and 

&#8226; timing of any regulatory changes, particularly with respect to trade sanctions and customs duties and tariffs, and tax reform.",Business Risk
"The foregoing factors are often difficult to predict, and these, as well as other factors, could materially adversely affect our quarterly or annual operating results.",Financial Risk
"In addition, a significant amount of our operating expenses are relatively fixed in nature.",General Risk
Any failure to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for a revenue shortfall could magnify the adverse impact of such revenue shortfall on our results of operations.,Business Risk
"As a result, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenue and operating results may not be meaningful or a reliable indicator of our future performance.",Market Risk
"If our operating results in one or more future quarters fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, a significant decline in the trading price of our common stock may occur, which may happen immediately or over time.",Market Risk
Failure to adjust our manufacturing and supply chain to accurately meet customer demand could adversely affect our results of operations.,Business Risk
"We make significant decisions, including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept, production schedules, levels of reliance on contract manufacturing and outsourcing, internal fabrication utilization and other resource requirements, based on our estimates of customer requirements, which may not be accurate.",Business Risk
"During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have moved largely to a build to order model and have extended customer lead times substantially in light of supply chain challenges.",Security Risk
"More typically, however, to ensure the availability of our semiconductor products we start manufacturing based on customer forecasts, which are not binding.",Technology Risk
"As a result, we incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales that may be substantially lower than expected.",Business Risk
"If actual demand for our products is lower than forecast, we may also experience higher inventory carrying and operating costs and product obsolescence.",Business Risk
"Because certain of our sales, research and development, and internal manufacturing overhead expenses are relatively fixed, a reduction in customer demand may also decrease our gross margin and operating income.",Business Risk
"Conversely, customers often require rapid increases in production on short notice.",Market Risk
"If we are unable to meet such increases in demand, this could damage our customer relationships, reduce revenue growth and margins, subject us to additional liabilities, harm our reputation, and prevent us from taking advantage of opportunities.",Business Risk
"Winning business in the semiconductor solutions industry is subject to a lengthy process that often requires us to incur significant expense, from which we may ultimately generate no revenue.",Business Risk
"Our semiconductor business is dependent on us winning competitive bid selection processes, known as &#8220;design wins&#8221;.",Business Risk
These selection processes are typically lengthy and can require us to dedicate significant development expenditures and scarce engineering resources in pursuit of a single customer opportunity.,General Risk
Failure to obtain a particular design win may prevent us from obtaining design wins in subsequent generations of a particular product.,Business Risk
This can result in lost revenue and can weaken our position in future selection processes.,Business Risk
Winning a product design does not guarantee sales to a customer.,Business Risk
"A delay or cancellation of a customer&#8217;s plans could materially and adversely affect our financial results, as we incur significant expense in the design process and may generate little or no revenue from it.",Financial Risk
"In addition, the timing of design wins is unpredictable and implementing production for a major design win, or multiple design wins at the same time, may strain our resources and those of our CMs.",Business Risk
"In such event, we may be forced to dedicate significant additional resources and incur additional costs and expenses.",Financial Risk
"Further, often customers will only purchase limited numbers of evaluation units until they qualify the products and/or the manufacturing line for those products.",Market Risk
The qualification process can take significant time and resources.,Financial Risk
Delays in qualification or failure to qualify our products may cause a customer to discontinue use of our products and result in a significant loss of revenue.,Business Risk
"Finally, customers could choose at any time to stop using our products or could fail to successfully market and sell their products, which could reduce demand for our products, and cause us to hold excess inventory, materially adversely affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations.",Business Risk
"These risks are exacerbated by the fact that many of our products, and the end products into which our products are incorporated, often have very short life cycles.",Business Risk
Competition in our industries could prevent us from growing our revenue.,Market Risk
"The industries in which we operate are highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological changes, evolving industry standards, changes in customer requirements, often aggressive pricing practices and, in some cases, new delivery methods.",Market Risk
We expect competition in these industries to continue to increase as existing competitors improve or expand their product offerings or as new competitors enter our markets.,Market Risk
"Some of our competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, a larger installed customer base, larger technical staffs, more established relationships with vendors or suppliers, or greater manufacturing, distribution, financial, research and development, technical and marketing resources than us.",Technology Risk
"We also face competition from numerous smaller companies that specialize in specific aspects of the highly fragmented software industry, open source authors who provide software and IP for free, competitors who offer their products through try-and-buy or freemium models, and customers who develop competing products.",Market Risk
"In addition, the trend toward consolidation is changing the competitive landscape.",Market Risk
"We expect this trend to continue, which may result in combined competitors having greater resources than us.",Market Risk
"Some of our competitors may also receive financial and other support from their home country government or may have a greater presence in key markets, a larger customer base, a more comprehensive IP portfolio or better patent protection than us.",Legal Risk
"The actions of our competitors, in the areas of pricing and product bundling in particular, could have a substantial adverse impact on us.",Business Risk
"Further, competitors may leverage their superior market position, as well as IP or other proprietary information, including interface, interoperability or technical information, in new and emerging technologies and platforms that may inhibit our ability to compete effectively.",Technology Risk
"If we are unable to compete successfully, we may lose market share for our products or incur significant reduction in our gross margins, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.",Business Risk
"A prolonged disruption of our manufacturing facilities, research and development facilities, warehouses or other significant operations, or those of our suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",Business Risk
"Although we operate a primarily outsourced manufacturing business model, we also rely on our own manufacturing facilities, in particular in Fort Collins, Colorado, Singapore, and Breinigsville, Pennsylvania.",Market Risk
We use these internal fabrication facilities for products utilizing our innovative and proprietary processes.,Financial Risk
"Our Fort Collins and Breinigsville facilities are the sole sources for the FBAR components used in many of our wireless devices and for the indium phosphide-based wafers used in our fibre optics products, respectively.",Technology Risk
"Many of our facilities, and those of our CMs and suppliers, are located in California and the Pacific Rim region, which have above average seismic activity and severe weather activity.",Business Risk
"In addition, a significant majority of our research and development personnel are located the Czech Republic, India, Israel and the U.S., with the expertise of the personnel at each such location tending to be focused on one or two specific areas, and our primary warehouse is in Malaysia.",Market Risk
"A prolonged disruption at or shut-down of one or more of our manufacturing facilities or warehouses, especially our Colorado, Singapore, Malaysia and Pennsylvania facilities, or those of our CMs or suppliers, due to natural- or man-made disasters or other events outside of our control, such as equipment malfunction or widespread outbreaks of acute illness, including COVID-19, or for any other reason, would limit our capacity to meet customer demands and delay new product development until a replacement facility and equipment, if necessary, were found.",Business Risk
"To date, we have not experienced a material event, however such event could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue, result in us being unable to timely satisfy customer demand, expose us to claims by our customers, result in significant expense to repair or replace our affected facilities, and, in some instances, could significantly curtail our research and development efforts in a particular product area or target market.",Business Risk
"As a result, we could forgo revenue opportunities, potentially lose market share, damage our customer relationships and be subject to litigation and additional liabilities, all of which could materially and adversely affect our business.",Business Risk
"Although we purchase insurance to mitigate certain losses, such insurance often carries a high deductible amount and any uninsured losses could negatively affect our operating results.",Business Risk
"In addition, even if we were able to promptly resume production of our affected products, if our customers cannot timely resume their own manufacturing following such an event, they may cancel or scale back their orders from us and this may in turn adversely affect our results of operations.",Business Risk
Such events could also result in increased fixed costs relative to the revenue we generate and adversely affect our results of operations.,Business Risk
"We may be unable to maintain appropriate manufacturing capacity or product yields at our own manufacturing facilities, which could adversely affect our relationships with our customers, and our business, financial condition and results of operations.",Business Risk
We must maintain appropriate capacity and product yields at our own manufacturing facilities to meet anticipated customer demand.,Business Risk
"From time to time, this requires us to invest in expansion or improvements of those facilities, which often involves substantial cost and other risks.",Business Risk
"Such expanded manufacturing capacity may still be insufficient, or may not come online soon enough, to meet customer demand and we may have to put customers on product allocation, forgo sales or lose customers as a result.",Business Risk
"Conversely, if we overestimate customer demand, we would experience excess capacity and fixed costs at these facilities will not be fully absorbed, all of which could adversely affect our results of operations.",Business Risk
"Similarly, reduced product yields, due to design or manufacturing issues or otherwise, may involve significant time and cost to remedy and cause delays in our ability to supply product to our customers, all of which could cause us to forgo sales, incur liabilities or lose customers, and harm our results of operations.",Business Risk
"An impairment of the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of our IT systems, or those of one or more of our corporate infrastructure vendors could have a material adverse effect on our business.",Technology Risk
"Our business depends on various internally managed IT systems and outsourced IT services, including cloud-based and other critical corporate infrastructure services relating to, among other things, financial reporting, product orders and shipping, human resources, benefit plan administration, IT network development, network monitoring and electronic communication services, as well as third-party data centers.",Technology Risk
"Any failure of these internal or third-party systems and services to operate effectively could disrupt our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",Business Risk
Our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our IT infrastructure against damage from business continuity events that could have a significant disruptive effect.,Technology Risk
"Although these systems are designed to protect and secure our customers&#8217;, suppliers&#8217; and employees&#8217; confidential information, as well as our own proprietary information, we are, out of necessity, dependent on our vendors to adequately address cyber security threats to their own systems.",Security Risk
"In addition, software products we use (including technologies produced by us) have occasionally had in the past and may have in the future, vulnerabilities that, if left unmanaged, could reduce the overall level of security of the systems on which the software is installed.",Technology Risk
"Cyber-attacks are increasing in number and sophistication, are well-financed, in some cases supported by state actors, and are designed to not only attack, but also to evade detection.",Security Risk
"Since the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to systems, or to otherwise sabotage them, change frequently and are often not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.",Security Risk
"Geopolitical instability, such as Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine, may increase the likelihood that we will experience direct or collateral consequences from cyber conflicts between nation-states or other politically motivated actors targeting critical technology infrastructure.",Security Risk
"Accidental or willful security breaches or other unauthorized access to our information systems or the systems of our service providers, or the existence of computer viruses or malware (such as ransomware) in our or their data or software could expose us to a risk of information loss, business disruption, and misappropriation of proprietary and confidential information, including information relating to our products or customers and the personal information of our employees or third parties.",Security Risk
"Such an event could disrupt our business and result in, among other things, unfavorable publicity, damage to our reputation, loss of our trade secrets and other competitive information, litigation by affected parties and possible financial obligations for liabilities and damages related to the theft or misuse of such information, significant remediation costs, disruption of key business operations and significant diversion of our resources, as well as fines and other sanctions resulting from any related breaches of data privacy regulations (such as the General Data Protection Regulation), any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, profitability and financial condition.",Business Risk
"While we may be entitled to damages if our vendors fail to perform under their agreements with us, any award may be insufficient to cover the actual costs incurred by us and, as a result of a vendor&#8217;s failure to perform, we may be unable to collect any damages.",Legal Risk
"Despite our internal controls and investment in security measures, we have, from time to time, been subject to disruptive cyber-attacks or there have been attempts of unauthorized network intrusions and malware on our own IT networks.",Security Risk
"Although no such cyber security incidents have been material to Broadcom, we continue to devote resources to protect our systems and data from unauthorized access or misuse, and we may be required to expend greater resources in the future.",Security Risk
U.S. and foreign regulators have also increased their focus on cyber security vulnerabilities and risks.,Security Risk
"Compliance with laws and regulations concerning privacy, cyber security, data governance, and data protection could result in significant expense, and any failure to comply could result in proceedings against us by regulatory authorities or other third parties.",Legal Risk
"Further, customers and service providers increasingly demand rigorous contractual, certification and audit provisions regarding privacy, cyber security, data governance, data protection, confidentiality, and IP, which may also increase our overall compliance burden.",Security Risk
"Our gross margin is dependent on a number of factors, including our product mix, price erosion, acquisitions we may make, level of capacity utilization and commodity prices.",Business Risk
"Our gross margin is highly dependent on product mix, which is susceptible to seasonal and other fluctuations in our markets.",Market Risk
"A shift in sales mix away from our higher margin products, as well as the timing and amount of our software licensing and non-product revenue, could adversely affect our future gross margin percentages.",Business Risk
"In addition, increased competition and the existence of product alternatives, more complex engineering requirements, lower demand, industry oversupply or reductions in our technological lead compared to our competitors, and other factors have in the past and may in the future lead to further price erosion, lower revenue and lower margin.",Market Risk
"Conversely, periods of robust demand that create a supply imbalance, as we have seen recently, can lead to higher gross margins that may not be sustainable over the longer term.",Market Risk
"In addition, semiconductor manufacturing requires significant capital investment, leading to high fixed costs, including depreciation expense.",Technology Risk
"If we are unable to utilize our owned manufacturing facilities at a high level, the fixed costs associated with these facilities will not be fully absorbed, resulting in higher average unit costs and a lower gross margin.",Business Risk
"Furthermore, we do not hedge our exposure to commodity prices, some of which are very volatile, and sudden or prolonged increases in commodities prices may adversely affect our gross margin.",Business Risk
Our gross margin may also be adversely affected if businesses or companies that we acquire have different gross margin profiles and by expenses related to such acquisitions.,Business Risk
We utilize a significant amount of IP in our business.,Technology Risk
"If we are unable or fail to protect our IP, our business could be adversely affected.",Business Risk
Our success depends in part upon protecting our IP.,Security Risk
"To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of IP rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as customary contractual protections with our customers, suppliers, employees and consultants.",Legal Risk
"We spend significant resources to monitor and protect our IP rights, including the unauthorized use of our products, usage rates of the software seat licenses and subscriptions that we sell, and even with significant expenditures, we may not be able to protect the IP rights that are valuable to our business.",Business Risk
"We are unable to predict or assure that: 

&#8226; our IP rights will not lapse or be invalidated, circumvented, challenged, or, in the case of third-party IP rights licensed to us, be licensed to others; 

&#8226; our IP rights will provide competitive advantages to us; 

&#8226; rights previously granted by third parties to IP licensed or assigned to us, including portfolio cross-licenses, will not hamper our ability to assert our IP rights or hinder the settlement of currently pending or future disputes; 

&#8226; any of our pending or future patent, trademark or copyright applications will be issued or have the coverage originally sought; 

&#8226; our IP rights will be enforced in certain jurisdictions where competition is intense or where legal protection may be weak; or 

&#8226; we have sufficient IP rights to protect our products or our business.",Legal Risk
"Effective IP protection may be unavailable or more limited in other jurisdictions, relative to those protections available in the U.S., and may not be applied for or may be abandoned in one or more relevant jurisdictions.",Legal Risk
"In addition, when patents expire, we lose the protection and competitive advantages they provided to us.",Legal Risk
We also generate revenue from licensing royalty payments and from technology claim settlements relating to certain of our IP.,Technology Risk
"Licensing of our IP rights, particularly exclusive licenses, may limit our ability to assert those IP rights against third parties, including the licensee of those rights.",Legal Risk
"In addition, we may acquire companies with IP that is subject to licensing obligations to other third parties.",Legal Risk
These licensing obligations may extend to our own IP following any such acquisition and may limit our ability to assert our IP rights.,Legal Risk
"From time to time, we pursue litigation to assert our IP rights, including, in some cases, against our customers and suppliers.",Legal Risk
Claims of this sort could also harm our relationships with our customers and might deter future customers from doing business with us.,Business Risk
"Conversely, third parties have and may in the future pursue IP litigation against us, including as a result of our IP licensing business.",Legal Risk
"An adverse decision in such types of legal action could limit our ability to assert our IP rights and limit the value of our technology, including the loss of opportunities to sell or license our technology to others or to collect royalty payments, which could otherwise negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.",Legal Risk
"From time to time, we may need to obtain additional IP licenses or renew existing license agreements.",Legal Risk
We are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable terms or at all.,Legal Risk
"If our software products do not remain compatible with ever-changing operating environments, platforms, or third-party products, demand for our products and services could decrease, which could materially adversely affect our business.",Technology Risk
"We may be required to make substantial modification of our products to maintain compatibility with operating systems, systems software and computer hardware used by our customers or to provide our customers with desired features or capabilities.",Technology Risk
"W e must also continually address the challenges of dynamic and accelerating market trends and competitive developments, such as the emergence of advanced persistent threats in the security space to compete effectively.",Security Risk
There can be no assurance that we will be able to adapt our products in response to these developments.,Technology Risk
"Further, our software solutions interact with a variety of software and hardware developed by third parties.",Security Risk
"If we lose access to third-party code and specifications for the development of code, this could negatively impact our ability to develop compatible software.",Technology Risk
"In addition, if software providers and hardware manufacturers, including some of our largest vendors, adopt new policies restricting the use or availability of their code or technical documentation for their operating systems, applications, or hardware, or otherwise impose unfavorable terms and conditions for such access, this could result in higher research and development costs for the enhancement and modification of our existing products or development of new products.",Market Risk
"Any additional restrictions could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results and cash flow.",Business Risk
Failure to enter into software license agreements on a satisfactory basis could materially adversely affect our business.,Business Risk
"Many of our existing customers have multi-year enterprise software license agreements, some of which involve substantial aggregate fee amounts.",Technology Risk
"Customer renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including the level of customer satisfaction with our solutions or customer support, customer budgets and the pricing of our solutions as compared with the solutions offered by our competitors, any of which may cause our revenue to grow more slowly than expected, if at all.",Business Risk
"The failure to renew customer agreements of similar scope, on terms that are commercially attractive to us, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results and cash flow.",Business Risk
"Certain software that we use in our products is licensed from third parties and may not be available to us in the future, which may delay product development and production or cause us to incur additional expense.",Technology Risk
"Some of our solutions contain software licensed from third parties, some of which may not be available to us in the future on terms that are acceptable to us or allow our products to remain competitive.",Technology Risk
"The loss of these licenses or the inability to 

maintain any of them on commercially acceptable terms could delay development of future products or the enhancement of existing products.",Market Risk
"Certain software we use is from open source code sources, which, under certain circumstances could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow.",Technology Risk
"Some of our products contain software from open source code sources, the use of which may subject us to certain conditions, including the obligation to offer such products for no cost or to make the proprietary source code of those products publicly available.",Legal Risk
"Further, although some open source vendors provide warranty and support agreements, it is common for such software to be available &#8220;as-is&#8221; with no warranty, indemnity or support.",Technology Risk
"Although we monitor our use of such open source code to avoid subjecting our products to unintended conditions, such use, under certain circumstances, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results and cash flow, including if we are required to take remedial action that may divert resources away from our development efforts.",Business Risk
Failure of our software products to manage and secure IT infrastructures and environments could have a material adverse effect on our business.,Security Risk
"Certain aspects of our software products are intended to manage and secure IT infrastructures and environments, and as a result, we expect these products to be ongoing targets of cyber security attacks.",Security Risk
Open source code or other third-party software used in these products could also be targeted.,Security Risk
"Although we continually seek to improve our countermeasures to prevent such incidents, we may be unable to anticipate every scenario and it is possible that certain cyber threats or vulnerabilities will be undetected or unmitigated in time to prevent an attack or an accidental incident on us and our customers.",Security Risk
"Additionally, efforts by malicious cyber actors or others could cause interruptions, delays or cessation of our product licensing, or modification of our software, which could cause us to lose existing or potential customers.",Security Risk
"A successful cyber security attack involving our products could cause customers and potential customers to believe our services are ineffective or unreliable and result in, among other things, the loss of customers, unfavorable publicity, damage to our reputation, difficulty in marketing our products, allegations by our customers that we have not performed our contractual obligations and give rise to significant costs, including costs related to developing solutions or indemnification obligations under our agreements.",Security Risk
Any such event could adversely impact our revenue and results of operations.,Business Risk
"See also &#8220; An impairment of the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of our IT systems, or those of one or more of our corporate infrastructure vendors, could have a material adverse effect on our business &#8221;.",Technology Risk
"We are subject to warranty claims, product recalls and product liability.",Legal Risk
"From time to time, we may be subject to warranty or product liability claims that may lead to significant expense.",Legal Risk
"Our customer contracts typically contain warranty and indemnification provisions, and in certain cases may also contain liquidated damages provisions, relating to product quality issues.",Legal Risk
"The potential liabilities associated with such provisions are significant, and in some cases, including in agreements with some of our largest customers, are potentially unlimited.",Legal Risk
Any such liabilities may greatly exceed any revenue we receive from the relevant products.,Financial Risk
"Costs, payments or damages incurred or paid by us in connection with warranty and product liability claims and product recalls could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.",Business Risk
We may also be exposed to such claims as a result of any acquisition we may undertake in the future.,Legal Risk
"Product liability insurance is subject to significant deductibles and there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims, or we may elect to self-insure with respect to certain matters.",Technology Risk
"For example, it is possible for one of our customers to recall a product containing one of our semiconductor devices.",Business Risk
"In such an event, we may incur significant costs and expenses, including among others, replacement costs, contract damage claims from our customers and reputational harm.",Business Risk
"Although we maintain reserves for reasonably estimable liabilities and purchase product liability insurance, our reserves may be inadequate to cover the uninsured portion of such claims.",Financial Risk
"Conversely, in some cases, amounts we reserve may ultimately exceed our actual liability for particular claims and may need to be reversed.",Financial Risk
"The complexity of our products could result in unforeseen delays or expense or undetected defects or bugs, which could adversely affect the market acceptance of new products, damage our reputation with current or prospective customers, and materially and adversely affect our operating costs.",Market Risk
"Highly complex products, such as those we offer, may contain defects and bugs when they are first introduced or as new versions, software documentation or enhancements are released, or their release may be delayed due to unforeseen difficulties during product development.",Technology Risk
"If any of our products or third-party components used in our products, contain defects or bugs, or have reliability, quality or compatibility problems, we may not be able to successfully design workarounds.",Technology Risk
"Furthermore, if any of these problems are not discovered until after we have commenced commercial production or deployment of a new product, we may be required to incur additional development costs and product recall, repair or replacement costs.",Business Risk
"Significant technical challenges also arise with our software products because our customers license and deploy our products across a variety of computer platforms and integrate them with a number of third-party software 

applications and databases.",Technology Risk
"As a result, if there is system-wide failure or an actual or perceived breach of information integrity, security or availability occurs in one of our end-user customer&#8217;s system, it can be difficult to determine which product is at fault and we could ultimately be harmed by the failure of another supplier&#8217;s product.",Security Risk
"Consequently, our reputation may be damaged and customers may be reluctant to buy our products, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers.",Business Risk
"To resolve these problems, we may have to invest significant capital and other resources and we would likely lose, or experience a delay in, market acceptance of the affected product or products.",Business Risk
These problems may also result in claims against us by our customers or others.,Legal Risk
"For example, if a delay in the manufacture and delivery of our products causes the delay of a customer&#8217;s end-product delivery, we may be required, under the terms of our agreement with that customer, to compensate the customer for the adverse effects of such delays.",Business Risk
"As a result, our financial results could be materially adversely affected.",Financial Risk
"We make substantial investments in research and development and unsuccessful investments could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.",Business Risk
"The industries in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological change, changes in customer requirements, frequent new product introductions and enhancements, short product cycles and evolving industry standards, and new delivery methods.",Technology Risk
"In addition, semiconductor products transition over time to increasingly smaller line width geometries and failure to successfully transition to smaller geometry process technologies could impair our competitive position.",Technology Risk
"In order to remain competitive, we have made, and expect to continue to make, significant investments in research and development.",Technology Risk
"If we fail to develop new and enhanced products and technologies, if we focus on technologies that do not become widely adopted, or if new competitive technologies that we do not support become widely accepted, demand for our products may be reduced.",Technology Risk
"Increased investments in research and development or unsuccessful research and development efforts could cause our cost structure to fall out of alignment with demand for our products, which would have a negative impact on our financial results.",Business Risk
"We collect, use, store, or otherwise process personal information, which subjects us to privacy and data security laws and contractual commitments, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such laws and commitments could harm our business.",Business Risk
"We collect, use and store (collectively, &#8220;process&#8221;) a high volume, variety and velocity of certain personal information in connection with the operation of our business.",Security Risk
"This creates various levels of privacy risks across different parts of our business, depending on the type of personal information, the jurisdiction in question and the purpose of their processing.",Business Risk
"The personal information we process is subject to an increasing number of federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy and data security, as well as contractual commitments.",Security Risk
"Privacy legislation and other data protection regulations, enforcement and policy activity in this area are expanding rapidly in many jurisdictions and creating a complex regulatory compliance environment.",Technology Risk
"Sectoral legislation, certification requirements and technical standards applying to certain categories of our customers, such as those is the financial services or public sector, are likely to further exacerbate this trend.",Financial Risk
"The cost of complying with and implementing these privacy-related and data governance measures could be significant as they may create additional burdensome security, business process, business record or data localization requirements.",Security Risk
"Concerns about government interference, sovereignty, expanding privacy, cyber security and data governance legislation could adversely affect our customers and our products and services, particularly in cloud computing, artificial intelligence and our own data management practices.",Security Risk
"The theft, loss or misuse of personal data collected, used, stored or transferred by us to run our business could result in significantly increased business and security costs or costs related to defending legal claims.",Security Risk
"Any inadvertent failure or perceived failure by us to comply with privacy, data governance or cyber security obligations may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation, substantial fines and damages, and could cause our customers to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business.",Security Risk
"We are subject to environmental, health and safety laws, which could increase our costs, restrict our operations and require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.",Legal Risk
"We are subject to a variety of domestic and international laws and regulations relating to the use, disposal, clean-up of and human exposure to hazardous materials.",Legal Risk
"Compliance with environmental, health and safety requirements could, among other things, require us to modify our manufacturing processes, restrict our ability to expand our facilities, or require us to acquire pollution control equipment, all of which can be very costly.",Business Risk
Any failure by us to comply with such requirements could result in the limitation or suspension of the manufacture of our products and could result in litigation against us and the payment of significant fines and damages by us in the event of a significant adverse judgment.,Legal Risk
"In addition, complying with any cleanup or remediation obligations for which we are or become responsible could be costly and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",Business Risk
"Changing requirements relating to the materials composition of our semiconductor products, including the restrictions on lead and certain other substances in electronic products sold in various countries, including the U.S., China and Japan, and in the European Union, increase the complexity and costs of our product design and procurement operations and may require us to re-engineer our products.",Technology Risk
Such re-engineering may result in excess inventory or other additional costs and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.,Business Risk
We may also experience claims from employees from time to time with regard to exposure to hazardous materials or other workplace related environmental claims.,Business Risk
"Social and environmental regulations, policies and provisions, as well as customer and investor demands, may make our supply chain more complex and may adversely affect our relationships with customers and investors.",Business Risk
"There is an increasing focus on corporate social and environmental responsibility in the semiconductor industry, particularly with OEMs that manufacture consumer electronics.",Market Risk
"A number of our customers have adopted, or may adopt, procurement policies that include social and environmental responsibility provisions or requirements that their suppliers should comply with, or they may seek to include such provisions or requirements in their procurement terms and conditions.",Market Risk
"An increasing number of investors are also requiring companies to disclose corporate social and environmental policies, practices and metrics.",Market Risk
"In addition, various jurisdictions are developing climate change-based laws or regulations that could cause us to incur additional direct costs for compliance, as well as indirect costs resulting from our customers, suppliers, or both incurring additional compliance costs that are passed on to us.",Business Risk
"These legal and regulatory requirements, as well as investor expectations, on corporate environmental and social responsibility practices and disclosure, are subject to change, can be unpredictable, and may be difficult and expensive for us to comply with, given the complexity of our supply chain and our significant outsourced manufacturing.",Legal Risk
"If we are unable to comply, or are unable to cause our suppliers or CMs to comply, with such policies or provisions or meet the requirements of our customers and investors, a customer may stop purchasing products from us or an investor may sell their shares, and may take legal action against us, which could harm our reputation, revenue and results of operations.",Business Risk
"In addition, as part of their corporate social and environmental responsibility programs, an increasing number of OEMs are seeking to source products that do not contain minerals sourced from areas where proceeds from the sale of such minerals are likely to be used to fund armed conflicts, such as in the Democratic Republic of Congo.",Market Risk
"This could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of minerals used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices, including our products.",Market Risk
"As a result, we may face difficulties in satisfying these customers&#8217; demands, which may harm our sales and operating results.",Business Risk
"The average selling prices of semiconductor products in our markets have often decreased rapidly and may do so in the future, which could harm our revenue and gross profit.",Business Risk
The semiconductor products we develop and sell are used for high volume applications.,Technology Risk
"As a result, the prices of those products have often decreased rapidly.",Market Risk
"Gross profit on our products may be negatively affected by, among other things, pricing pressures from our customers.",Business Risk
"In the past, we have reduced the average selling prices of our products in anticipation of future competitive pricing pressures, new product introductions by us or our competitors and other factors.",Market Risk
"In addition, some of our customer agreements provide for volume-based pricing and product pricing roadmaps, which can also reduce the average selling prices of our products over time.",Market Risk
"Our margins and financial results will suffer if we are unable to offset any reductions in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volumes, reducing manufacturing costs, or developing new and higher value-added products on a timely basis.",Business Risk
Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could result in losses.,Financial Risk
We operate global businesses and our consolidated financial results are reported in U.S. dollars.,Market Risk
"However, some of the revenue and expenses of our foreign subsidiaries are denominated in local currencies.",Financial Risk
Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates against the U.S. dollar could result in substantial changes in reported revenues and operating results due to the foreign exchange impact of translating these transactions into U.S. dollars.,Market Risk
"In the normal course of business, we employ various hedging strategies to partially mitigate these risks, including the use of derivative instruments.",Business Risk
These strategies may not be effective in protecting us against the effects of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.,Market Risk
"As a result, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could result in financial losses.",Financial Risk
"Risks Related to Our Taxes 

Changes in tax legislation or policies could materially impact our financial position and results of operations.",Business Risk
"Corporate tax reform, anti-base-erosion rules and tax transparency continue to be high priorities in many jurisdictions.",Business Risk
"As a result, policies regarding corporate income and other taxes in numerous jurisdictions are under heightened scrutiny and tax reform legislation has been, and will likely continue to be, proposed or enacted in a number of jurisdictions in which we operate.",Legal Risk
"After enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, most of our income is taxable in the U.S. with a significant portion taxable under the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (&#8220;GILTI&#8221;) regime.",Business Risk
"Beginning in fiscal year 2027, the deduction allowable under the GILTI regime will decrease from 50% to 37.5%, which will increase the effective tax rate imposed on our income.",Legal Risk
"The U.S. also enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (&#8220;IRA&#8221;) in August 2022, which creates a new book minimum tax of at least 15% of consolidated GAAP pre-tax income for corporations with average book income in excess of $1 billion.",Financial Risk
"The book minimum tax will first apply to our fiscal year 2024 and any increase in our effective tax rate or cash tax will depend on a number of factors, including any offsets for foreign tax credits or general business credits, or changes in book income following business combinations.",Financial Risk
"The IRA also creates an excise tax of 1% of the value of any stock repurchased by us after December 31, 2022.",Market Risk
"We could be subject to this new excise tax, but the amount will vary depending on various factors, including the amount and frequency of any stock repurchases, applicability in certain business combination transactions, and any permitted reductions or exceptions to the amount subject to the tax.",Legal Risk
"If (i) the U.S. tax rate increases, (ii) the deduction allowable under the GILTI regime is further reduced or eliminated, (iii) additional limitations are put on our ability to deduct interest expense, or (iv) the requirement for research and development costs to be capitalized beginning in fiscal year 2023 remains in effect, our provision for income taxes, net income, and cash flows would be adversely impacted.",Financial Risk
"In addition, many countries are implementing legislation and other guidance to align their international tax rules with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development&#8217;s (&#8220;OECD&#8221;) Base Erosion and Profit Shifting recommendations and action plan that aim to standardize and modernize global corporate tax policy, including changes to cross-border tax, transfer pricing documentation rules, and nexus-based tax incentive practices.",General Risk
"The OECD is also continuing discussions surrounding fundamental changes in allocation of profits among tax jurisdictions in which companies do business, as well as the implementation of a global minimum tax (namely the &#8220;Pillar One&#8221; and &#8220;Pillar Two&#8221; proposals).",General Risk
"Some countries intend to implement laws based on Pillar Two proposals, which may adversely impact our provision for income taxes, net income and cash flows.",Legal Risk
"As a result of this heightened scrutiny, prior decisions by tax authorities regarding treatments and positions of corporate income taxes could be subject to enforcement activities, and legislative investigation and inquiry, which could also result in changes in tax policies or prior tax rulings.",Legal Risk
Any such changes may also result in the taxes we previously paid being subject to change.,General Risk
"Any substantial changes in domestic or international corporate tax policies, regulations or guidance, enforcement activities or legislative initiatives may materially adversely affect our business, the amount of taxes we are required to pay and our financial condition and results of operations generally.",Business Risk
"If the tax incentives or tax holiday arrangements we have negotiated change or cease to be in effect or applicable for any reason, or if our assumptions and interpretations regarding tax laws and incentives or holiday arrangements prove to be incorrect, our corporate income taxes could significantly increase.",Business Risk
Our operations are currently structured to benefit from the various tax incentives extended to us in various jurisdictions to encourage investment or employment.,General Risk
"For example, absent our principal tax incentives from the Singapore Economic Development Board, which is scheduled to expire in 2025, the corporate income tax rate that would apply to our Singapore taxable income would be 17%.",Business Risk
"We also have a tax holiday on our qualifying income in Malaysia, which is scheduled to expire in fiscal year 2028.",General Risk
"Each tax incentive and tax holiday is subject to our compliance with various operating and other conditions and may, in some instances, be amended or terminated prior to their scheduled termination date by the relevant governmental authority.",Legal Risk
"If we cannot, or elect not to, comply with the operating conditions included in any particular tax incentive or tax holiday, we could, in some instances, be required to refund previously realized material tax benefits, or if such tax incentive or tax holiday is terminated prior to its expiration absent a new incentive applying, we will lose the related tax benefits earlier than scheduled.",Legal Risk
"In addition, we may be required, or elect, to modify our operational structure and tax strategy in order to keep an incentive, which could result in a decrease in the benefits of the incentive.",Business Risk
Our tax incentives could also be adversely impacted if the global minimum tax provisions (Pillar Two) are adopted in a country in which we have an existing tax incentive.,Market Risk
"Our tax incentives and tax holiday, before taking into consideration U.S. foreign tax credits, decreased the provision for income taxes by approximately $ 1,821 million in the aggregate and increased diluted net income per share by $4.31 for fiscal year 2022.",Legal Risk
"Our interpretations and conclusions regarding the tax incentives are not binding on any taxing authority, and if our assumptions about tax and other laws are incorrect or if these tax incentives are substantially modified or rescinded, we could suffer material adverse tax and other financial consequences, which would increase our expenses, reduce our profitability and adversely affect our cash flows.",Financial Risk
"Our income taxes and overall cash tax costs are affected by a number of factors that could materially, adversely affect financial results.",Financial Risk
Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income taxes.,Legal Risk
"In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.",Business Risk
"Additionally, our calculations of income taxes payable currently and on a deferred basis are based on our interpretations of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which 

we are required to file tax returns.",Financial Risk
"Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, there is no assurance that the final determination of our income tax liability will not be materially different than what is reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals.",Business Risk
"Our income taxes are subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by numerous factors including: 

&#8226; reorganization or restructuring of our businesses, tangible and intangible assets, outstanding indebtedness and corporate structure; 

&#8226; jurisdictional mix of our income and assets; 

&#8226; changes in the allocation of income and expenses, including adjustments related to changes in our corporate structure, acquisitions or tax law; 

&#8226; changes in U.S and foreign tax laws and regulations, changes to the taxation of earnings of foreign subsidiaries, taxation of U.S. income generated from foreign sources, the deductibility of expenses attributable to income and foreign tax credit rules; 

&#8226; tax effects of increases in non-deductible employee compensation; and 

&#8226; changes in tax accounting rules or principles and in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities.",Financial Risk
"We have adopted transfer pricing policies that call for the provision of services, the sale of products, the arrangement of financing and the grant of licenses from one affiliate to another at prices that we believe are negotiated on an arm&#8217;s length basis.",Legal Risk
Our taxable income is dependent upon acceptance by local authorities that our operational practices and intercompany transfer pricing are on an arm&#8217;s length basis.,Legal Risk
"Due to inconsistencies in application of the arm&#8217;s length standard among taxing authorities, as well as lack of comprehensive treaty-based protection, transfer pricing challenges by tax authorities could, if successful, result in adjustments for prior or future years.",Legal Risk
"The effects of any such changes could subject us to higher taxes and our earnings, results of operations and cash flow would be adversely affected.",Business Risk
"In addition, we are subject to, and are under, tax audit in various jurisdictions, and such jurisdictions may assess additional income tax against us.",Legal Risk
"Although we believe our tax positions are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits could be materially different from our income tax provisions and accruals.",Business Risk
The ultimate result of an audit could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made.,Financial Risk
"Risks Related to Our Indebtedness 

Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and our ability to execute our business strategy.",Financial Risk
"As of October 30, 2022, the aggregate indebtedness under our senior notes was $41,218 million.",Financial Risk
This amount does not reflect any debt we expect to incur or assume in connection with the VMware Merger.,Financial Risk
"Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences including: 

&#8226; increasing our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions; 

&#8226; exposing us to interest rate risk due to our variable rate term facilities, which we do not typically hedge against; 

&#8226; limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the economy and the semiconductor industry; 

&#8226; placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with less indebtedness; 

&#8226; making it more difficult to borrow additional funds in the future to fund growth, acquisitions, working capital, capital expenditures and other purposes; and 

&#8226; potentially requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund our other business needs.",Business Risk
"We receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies in the U.S. Factors that may impact our credit ratings include debt levels, planned asset purchases or sales and near-term and long-term production growth opportunities.",Financial Risk
"Liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, reserve mix and commodity pricing levels could also be considered by the rating agencies.",Financial Risk
"While we are focused on maintaining investment grade ratings from these agencies, we may be unable to do so.",Financial Risk
"Any downgrade in our credit rating or the ratings of our indebtedness, or adverse conditions in the debt capital markets, could:

The instruments governing our indebtedness impose certain restrictions on our business.,Financial Risk
The instruments governing our indebtedness contain certain covenants imposing restrictions on our business.,Financial Risk
"These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business, to plan for, or react to, changes in the market conditions or our capital needs and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise.",Business Risk
"The restrictions placed on us include maintenance of an interest coverage ratio and limitations on our ability to incur certain secured debt, enter into certain sale and lease-back transactions and consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets.",Financial Risk
"In addition, the instruments contain customary events of default upon the occurrence of which, after any applicable grace period, the indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable.",Financial Risk
"In such event, we may not have sufficient available cash to repay such debt at the time it becomes due, or be able to refinance such debt on acceptable terms or at all.",Financial Risk
"Any of the foregoing could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.",Financial Risk
"Servicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt.",Financial Risk
"Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on, and to refinance our debt, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors.",Financial Risk
Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to satisfy our obligations under our current indebtedness and any future indebtedness we may incur and to make necessary capital expenditures.,Financial Risk
"If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying investments or capital expenditures, selling assets, refinancing or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive.",Financial Risk
Our ability to refinance our outstanding indebtedness or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time.,Market Risk

"These and many other factors described in this report could adversely affect our operations, performance and financial condition.",Financial Risk
"Risks Related to Our Ability to Grow Our Business 

The markets in which we participate are intensely competitive, and if we cannot continue to develop, acquire, market and offer new products and services or enhancements to existing products and services that meet customer requirements, our operating results could suffer.",Business Risk
"The markets for our products and services are characterized by intense competition, new industry standards, evolving distribution models, limited barriers to entry, new technology developments, short product life cycles, customer price sensitivity, global market conditions and frequent product introductions (including alternatives with limited functionality available at lower costs or free of charge).",Market Risk
"Any of these factors could create downward pressure on pricing and gross margins and could adversely affect our renewal and upsell and cross-sell rates, as well as our ability to attract new customers.",Business Risk
"Our future success will depend on our continued ability to enhance and integrate our existing products and services, introduce new products and services in a timely and cost-effective manner, meet changing customer expectations and needs, extend our core technology into new applications, and anticipate emerging standards, business models, software delivery methods and other technological developments.",Technology Risk
"For example, consumers continue to migrate from personal computers to tablet and mobile devices and from desktop to the web.",Technology Risk
"While we offer our products on a variety of platforms, if we cannot continue adapting our products to tablet and mobile devices or the web, or if our competitors can adapt their products more quickly than us, our business could be harmed.",Business Risk
"In addition, releases of new devices or operating systems may make it more difficult for our products to perform or may require significant cost to adapt our solutions.",Technology Risk
The potential costs and delays incurred as a result could harm our business.,Business Risk
"If we fail to anticipate or misjudge customers&#8217; rapidly changing needs and expectations or adapt to emerging technological trends, our market share and results of operations could suffer.",Business Risk
"Furthermore, some of our competitors and potential competitors enjoy competitive advantages, such as greater financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources, broader brand awareness and access to larger customer bases.",Market Risk
"As a result of these advantages, potential and current customers might select the products and services of our competitors, causing a loss of our market share.",Market Risk
"Our competitors, including large enterprises, may develop products, features or services that are similar to ours or that achieve greater acceptance, may undertake more far-reaching and successful product development efforts or marketing campaigns, or may adopt more aggressive pricing policies.",Market Risk
"For additional information regarding our competition and the risks arising out of the competitive environment in which we operate, see the section titled &#8220;Competition&#8221; contained in Part I, Item 1 of this report.",Business Risk
Introduction of new technology could harm our business and results of operations.,Technology Risk
The expectations and needs of technology consumers are constantly evolving.,Technology Risk
"As new technology is developed, integration of our products and services with one another and other companies&#8217; offerings creates an increasingly complex ecosystem that is also partly reliant on third parties.",Technology Risk

&#8226; incompatibility of business cultures.",Security Risk
Mergers and acquisitions of technology companies are inherently risky.,Technology Risk
"If we do not complete an announced acquisition transaction, including the pending acquisition of Figma, Inc., or integrate an acquired business successfully and in a timely manner, we may not realize the benefits of the acquisition to the extent anticipated, and in certain circumstances an acquisition could harm our financial position.",Financial Risk
"Our ability to acquire other businesses or technologies, make strategic investments or integrate acquired businesses effectively may also be impaired by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including government actions in light of the pandemic, trade tensions, restrictions and increased global scrutiny of foreign investments.",Business Risk
"For example, a number of countries, including the United States and countries in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, are considering or have adopted restrictions on foreign investments.",Market Risk
"Governments may continue to adopt or tighten restrictions of this nature, and such restrictions could negatively impact our business and financial results.",Business Risk
The success of some of our product and service offerings depends on our ability to continue to attract and retain customers of and contributors to our online marketplaces for creative content.,Market Risk
"The success of some of our product and service offerings, such as Adobe Stock, depends on our ability to continue to retain existing and attract new customers and contributors to these online marketplaces for creative content.",Market Risk

"As with many innovations, AI presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption, and therefore our business.",Technology Risk
"If we enable or offer solutions that draw controversy due to their perceived or actual impact on society, we may experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm or legal liability.",Legal Risk
"Potential government regulation related to AI use and ethics may also increase the burden and cost of research and development in this area, and failure to properly remediate AI usage or ethics issues may cause public confidence in AI to be undermined, which could slow adoption of AI in our products and services.",Technology Risk
"The rapid evolution of AI will require the application of resources to develop, test and maintain our products and services to help ensure that AI is implemented ethically in order to minimize unintended, harmful impact.",Technology Risk
"Uncertainty around new and emerging AI applications such as generative AI content creation may require additional investment in the development of proprietary datasets and machine learning models, 

development of new approaches and processes to provide attribution or remuneration to content creators and building systems that enable creatives to have greater control over the use of their work in the development of AI, which may be costly and could impact our profit margin if we decide to expand generative AI into all our product offerings.",Technology Risk
"Developing, testing, and deploying AI systems may also increase the cost profile of our offerings due to the nature of the computing costs involved in such systems.",Technology Risk

"If we fail to plan infrastructure capacity appropriately and expand it proportionally with the needs of our customer base, and we experience a rapid and significant demand on the capacity of our data centers or those of third parties, service outages or performance issues could occur, which would impact our customers.",Business Risk
"Such a strain on our infrastructure 

capacity could subject us to regulatory and customer notification requirements, violations of service level agreement commitments or financial liabilities and result in customer dissatisfaction or harm our business.",Business Risk
"If we supply materially inaccurate information or experience significant interruptions in our systems, our reputation could be harmed, we could lose customers and we could be found liable for damages or incur other losses.",Business Risk
"Security vulnerabilities in our products and systems, or in our supply chain, could lead to reduced revenue or to liability claims.",Security Risk
Maintaining the security of our products and services is a critical issue for us and our customers.,Security Risk
"Cyberthreats are constantly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated and complex, making it increasingly difficult to detect and successfully defend against them.",Security Risk
"Certain unauthorized parties have in the past managed, and may again in the future manage, to gain access to and misuse some of our systems and software, or that of our third-party service providers, in order to access the authentication, payment and personal information of our end users and employees.",Security Risk
"In addition, cyber-attackers (which may include individuals or groups, as well as sophisticated groups with significant resources, such as nation-state and state-sponsored attackers) also develop and deploy viruses, worms, credential stuffing attack tools and other malicious software programs, some of which may be specifically designed to attack our products, services, information systems or networks.",Security Risk
The frequency and sophistication of such threats continues to increase and often becomes further heightened in connection with geopolitical tensions.,Security Risk
"Hardware, software and operating system applications that we develop or procure from third parties have contained and may contain defects in design or manufacture, including bugs, vulnerabilities and other problems that could unexpectedly compromise the security of the system or impair a customer&#8217;s ability to operate or use our products.",Technology Risk
"Like other global companies, we face an increasingly difficult challenge to attract and retain highly qualified security personnel to assist us in combating these security threats.",Security Risk
"The costs to prevent, eliminate, mitigate or alleviate cyber or other security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities are significant, and our efforts to address these problems, including notifying affected parties, may not be successful or may be delayed and could result in interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers.",Security Risk
"It is impossible to predict the extent, frequency or impact these problems may have on us.",Financial Risk
"Outside parties have in the past and may in the future attempt to fraudulently induce our employees or users of our products or services to disclose sensitive, personal or confidential information via illegal electronic spamming, phishing or other tactics.",Security Risk
"This existing risk is compounded given the current hybrid model work environment, where a large portion of our workforce spends a portion of their time working in our offices and a portion of their time working from home.",Business Risk
"Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain physical access to our facilities in order to infiltrate our information systems or attempt to gain logical access to our products, services or information systems for the purpose of exfiltrating content and data.",Security Risk
"These actual and potential breaches of our security measures and the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unauthorized dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive, personal or confidential data about us, our employees, our customers or their end users, including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data could expose us, our employees, our customers or other individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information.",Security Risk
"This may result in litigation and liability or fines, costly and time-intensive notice requirements, governmental inquiry or oversight or a loss of customer confidence, any of which could harm our business or damage our brand and reputation, thereby requiring time and resources to mitigate these impacts.",Legal Risk
"These risks will likely increase as we expand our hosted offerings, integrate our products and services and store and process more data.",Technology Risk
"These issues affect our products and services in particular because cyber-attackers tend to focus their efforts on popular offerings with a large user base, and we expect them to continue to do so.",Security Risk
"From time to time we have identified, and in the future we may identify other, vulnerabilities in some of our applications and services and those of our third-party service providers.",Security Risk
"In some cases, such vulnerabilities may not be immediately detected, which may make it difficult to recover critical services and lead to damaged assets.",Security Risk
"We continuously monitor and develop our information technology networks and infrastructure in an effort to prevent, detect, address and mitigate the risk of threats to our data, systems and networks, including malware and computer virus attacks, ransomware, unauthorized access, business email compromise, misuse, denial-of-service attacks, system failures and disruptions.",Security Risk
"These continued enhancements and changes, as well as changes designed to update and enhance our protective measures to address new threats, may increase the risk of a system or process failure or the creation of a gap in the associated security measures.",Security Risk
"Any such failure or gap could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial results.",Business Risk
"We devote significant resources to address security vulnerabilities through engineering more secure products, enhancing security and reliability features in our products and systems, code hardening, conducting rigorous penetration tests, deploying updates to address security vulnerabilities, regularly reviewing our service providers&#8217; security controls, reviewing and auditing our hosted services against independent security control frameworks (such as ISO 27001, SOC 2 and PCI), providing resources, such as mandatory security training, for our workforce and improving our incident response time, but security vulnerabilities cannot be totally eliminated.",Security Risk
"The cost of undertaking these efforts could reduce our operating margins, and we may be unable to implement these measures quickly enough to prevent unauthorized access into our systems and products in all circumstances.",Security Risk
"Despite our preventative efforts, there is no assurance that our security measures will provide 

full effective protection from such events, and actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and systems may harm our reputation or lead to claims against us (and have in the past led to such claims) and could lead some customers to stop using certain products or services or to reduce or delay future purchases.",Security Risk
"If we do not make the appropriate level of investment in our technology systems and we are not able to deliver the quality of data security and privacy our customers require or that meet our independent security control certification requirements, our business could be adversely affected.",Security Risk
"Customers may also adopt security measures designed to protect their existing computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of new technologies.",Security Risk
"Moreover, delayed sales, lower margins or lost customers resulting from disruptions caused by cyber-attacks, overly burdensome preventative security measures or failure to fully meet independent security control certification requirements could adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation.",Security Risk
"Some of our enterprise offerings have extended and complex sales cycles, which can make our sales cycles unpredictable.",Market Risk
"Sales cycles for some of our enterprise offerings, including our Adobe Experience Cloud and Adobe Experience Platform solutions and Enterprise Term License Agreements (&#8220;ETLAs&#8221;) in our Digital Media business, are multi-phased and complex, which also makes it difficult to predict when a given sales cycle will close.",Market Risk
"The complexity in these sales cycles is due to several factors, including: 

&#8226; the need for our sales representatives to educate customers about the use and benefit of large-scale deployments of our products and services; 

&#8226; the desire of organizations to undertake significant evaluation processes to determine their technology requirements prior to making information technology expenditures and the need for our representatives to spend a significant amount of time assisting with such evaluations; 

&#8226; intensifying competition within the industry; 

&#8226; the negotiation of large, complex, enterprise-wide contracts; 

&#8226; the need for our customers to obtain requisition approvals from various decision makers within their organizations due to the complexity of our solutions touching multiple departments; and 

&#8226; customer budget constraints, economic conditions and unplanned administrative delays.",Market Risk
We spend substantial time and expense on our sales efforts without assurance that potential customers will ultimately purchase our solutions.,Business Risk
"As we target our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers, these trends are expected to continue and could have a greater impact on our results of operations.",Market Risk
"Additionally, our enterprise sales pattern has historically been uneven, where a higher percentage of a quarter&#8217;s total sales occur during the final weeks of each quarter, which is common in our industry.",Market Risk
Our business could be harmed if we fail to effectively manage critical strategic third-party business relationships.,Business Risk
"As our offerings expand and our customer base grows, our relationships with strategic partners become increasingly valuable.",General Risk
"If our contractual relationships with these third parties were to terminate, or if we were unable to renew on favorable terms, our business could be harmed.",Business Risk
"This is especially the case when the third party&#8217;s offerings are integrated with our products and services, or where the third party&#8217;s offerings are difficult to substitute or replace.",Market Risk
"Alternative arrangements for such products and services may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, and we may experience business interruptions upon a transition to an alternative partner.",Business Risk
"The failure of third parties to provide acceptable products and services or to update their technology may result in a disruption to our business operations and those of our customers, which may reduce our revenues and profits, cause us to lose customers and damage our reputation.",Business Risk
"We increasingly utilize third-party distribution platforms, such as Apple&#8217;s App Store and Google&#8217;s Play Store, for the distribution of certain of our product offerings.",Technology Risk
"Although we benefit from the strong brand recognition and large user base of these distribution platforms to attract new customers, the platform owners have wide discretion to change the pricing structure, terms of service and other policies with respect to us and other developers, and may offer or promote products that compete with our product offerings.",Business Risk
Adverse changes by these third parties could adversely affect our financial results.,Financial Risk
Failure of our third-party customer service and technical support providers to adequately address customers&#8217; requests could harm our business and adversely affect our financial results.,Business Risk
Our customers rely on our customer service support organization to resolve issues with our products and services.,General Risk
"We depend heavily, and expect to continue to rely heavily, on third-party customer service and technical support representatives to provide such services.",Market Risk
"This strategy presents risks to our business since we may not be able to influence the quality of support 

as directly as if our own employees performed these activities.",Business Risk
"Our customers may react negatively to providing information to, and receiving support from, third-party organizations, especially if these third-party organizations are based overseas.",Security Risk
"If we encounter problems with our third-party customer service and technical support providers, our reputation may be harmed, our ability to sell our offerings could be adversely affected, and we could lose customers and associated revenue.",Business Risk
"If we are unable to recruit and retain key personnel, our business may be harmed, and our attempts to operate under a hybrid work model may not be successful and adversely impact our business.",Business Risk
"Much of our future success depends on the continued service, availability and performance of our senior management and highly-skilled personnel across all levels of our organization.",General Risk
"Our senior management has acquired specialized knowledge and skills with respect to our business, and the loss of any of these individuals could harm our business, especially if we are not successful in developing adequate succession plans.",Business Risk
"Our efforts to attract, develop, integrate and retain highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications may be compounded by intensified restrictions on travel, immigration or the availability of work visas.",Business Risk
Competition for experienced personnel in the information technology industry is intense and has recently intensified further due to industry trends in many areas where our employees are located.,Market Risk
"Further, the increased availability of hybrid or remote working arrangements has expanded the pool of companies that can compete for our employees and employment candidates.",Market Risk
We may experience higher compensation costs to retain senior management and experienced personnel that may not be offset by improved productivity or increased sales.,Business Risk
"A hybrid work environment may also present operational, cybersecurity and workplace culture challenges.",Security Risk
"If we are unable to continue to successfully attract and retain highly skilled personnel and maintain our corporate culture in a hybrid work environment, our business may be harmed.",Business Risk
"We continue to hire personnel in countries where exceptional technical knowledge and other expertise are offered at lower costs, which increases the efficiency of our global workforce structure and reduces our personnel related expenditures.",Market Risk
"Nonetheless, as globalization continues, competition for employees in these countries has increased, which may impact our ability to retain these employees and increase our compensation-related expenses.",Business Risk
"We may continue to expand our international operations and international sales and marketing activities, which would require significant management attention and resources.",Business Risk
"We may be unable to scale our infrastructure effectively or as quickly as our competitors in these markets, and our revenue may not increase sufficiently to offset these expected increases in costs, causing our results to suffer.",Business Risk
"We believe that a critical contributor to our success to date has been our corporate culture, which we have built to foster innovation, teamwork and employee satisfaction.",Market Risk
"As we grow, including from the integration of employees and businesses acquired in connection with previous or future acquisitions, we may find it difficult to maintain important aspects of our corporate culture, which could negatively affect our ability to retain and recruit personnel who are essential to our future success.",Business Risk
"Failure to manage our sales, partner and distribution channels effectively could result in a loss of revenue and harm our business.",Business Risk
"We contract with a number of software distributors and other strategic partners, none of which are individually responsible for a material amount of our total net revenue in any recent period.",Technology Risk
"Nonetheless, if an agreement with one of our distributors were terminated, any prolonged delay in securing a replacement distributor could have a negative impact on our results of operations.",Business Risk
Successfully managing our indirect distribution channel efforts to reach various customer segments for our products and services is a complex process across the broad range of geographies where we do business or plan to do business.,Business Risk
Our distributors and other channel partners are independent businesses that we do not control.,Business Risk
"Notwithstanding the independence of our channel partners, we face legal risk and potential reputational harm from the activities of these third parties including, but not limited to, export control violations, workplace conditions, corruption and anti-competitive behavior.",Legal Risk
We cannot be certain that our distribution channel will continue to market or sell our products and services effectively.,Business Risk
"If our partner and distribution channels are not successful, we may lose sales opportunities, customers and revenue.",Business Risk
"If our distributors favor our competitors&#8217; products or services for any reason, they may fail to market our products or services effectively, which would cause our results to suffer.",Business Risk
"If our OEMs through which we distribute products and services decide not to bundle our applications on their devices, our results could suffer.",Business Risk
"Further, the financial health of our distributors and partners and our continuing relationships with them are important to our success.",Financial Risk
"Some of these distributors and partners may be unable to withstand adverse changes in economic conditions, which could result in insolvency, the inability of such distributors and partners to obtain credit to finance access to or purchases of our products and services, or a delay in paying their obligations to us.",Financial Risk
We also sell some of our products and services through our direct sales force.,Market Risk
"Risks associated with this sales channel include more extended sales and collection cycles, challenges related to hiring, retaining and motivating our direct sales force, 

and substantial amounts of ongoing training for sales representatives.",Business Risk
"Moreover, recent hires may not be as productive as we would like, as in most cases it takes significant time for them to achieve full productivity.",Business Risk
Our business could be seriously harmed if our expansion efforts of our direct sales do not generate a corresponding significant increase in revenue and we are unable to achieve the efficiencies we anticipate.,Business Risk
"In addition, the loss of key sales employees could impact our customer relationships and future ability to sell to certain accounts covered by such employees.",Business Risk
We face various risks associated with our operating as a multinational corporation.,Business Risk
"As a global business that generates approximately 42% of our total revenue from sales to customers outside of the Americas, we are subject to a number of risks, including: 

&#8226; inflation and actions taken by central banks to counter inflation; 

&#8226; foreign currency fluctuations and controls; 

&#8226; international and regional economic, political and labor conditions, including any instability or security concerns abroad, such as uncertainty caused by economic sanctions, trade disputes, armed conflicts and wars; 

&#8226; tax laws (including U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiaries); 

&#8226; increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities; 

&#8226; changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements; 

&#8226; changes in laws governing the free flow of data across international borders; 

&#8226; failure of laws to protect our intellectual property rights adequately; 

&#8226; inadequate local infrastructure and difficulties in managing and staffing international operations; 

&#8226; delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology, tariffs, quotas and other trade barriers; 

&#8226; the imposition of governmental economic sanctions on countries in which we do business or where we plan to expand our business; 

&#8226; costs and delays associated with developing products in multiple languages; 

&#8226; operating in locations with a higher incidence of corruption and fraudulent business practices; and 

&#8226; other factors beyond our control, such as terrorism, war, natural disasters, climate change and pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting restrictions on business activity, which may vary significantly by region.",Business Risk
"Some of our third-party business partners have international operations and are also subject to these risks, and our business may be harmed if such partners are unable to appropriately manage these risks.",Business Risk
"If sales to any of our customers outside of the Americas are reduced, delayed or canceled because of any of the above factors, our revenue may decline.",Business Risk
"Risks Related to Laws and Regulations 

We are subject to risks associated with compliance with laws and regulations globally, which may harm our business.",Business Risk
"We are a global company subject to varied and complex laws, regulations and customs, both domestically and internationally.",Legal Risk
"These laws and regulations relate to a number of aspects of our business, including trade protection, import and export control, anti-boycott, sanctions and embargoes, data and transaction processing security, payment card industry data security standards, records management, user-generated content hosted on websites we operate, privacy practices, data residency, corporate governance, anti-trust and competition, employee and third-party complaints, anti-corruption, gift policies, conflicts of interest, securities regulations and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment.",Security Risk
The application of these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear and may at times conflict.,Legal Risk
"For example, in many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by U.S. regulations applicable to us, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.",Legal Risk
"We cannot provide assurance that our employees, contractors, agents and business partners will not take actions in violation of our internal policies or U.S. laws.",Legal Risk
Compliance with these laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in our business practices that result in reduced revenue and profitability.,Legal Risk
"Non-compliance could also result in fines, damages, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation.",Legal Risk
"In addition, approximately 49% of our employees are located outside the United States.",Security Risk
"Accordingly, we are exposed to changes in laws governing our employee relationships in various U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, including laws and regulations regarding wage and hour requirements, fair labor standards, employee data privacy, unemployment tax rates, workers&#8217; compensation rates, citizenship requirements and payroll and other taxes, which likely would have a direct impact on our operating costs.",Legal Risk
Increasing regulatory focus on privacy and security issues and expanding laws could impact our business models and expose us to increased liability.,Security Risk
"As a global company, Adobe is subject to global data protection, privacy and security laws, regulations and codes of conduct that apply to our various business units and data processing activities.",Security Risk
"These laws, regulations and codes may be inconsistent across jurisdictions and are subject to evolving and differing (sometimes conflicting) interpretations.",Legal Risk
"Government officials and regulators, privacy advocates and class action attorneys are increasingly scrutinizing how companies collect, process, use, store, share and transmit personal data.",Legal Risk
"This increased scrutiny may result in new interpretations of existing laws, thereby further impacting Adobe&#8217;s business.",Business Risk
"Globally, laws such as the General Data Protection Regulation (&#8220;GDPR&#8221;) in Europe and the Personal Information Protection Law (&#8220;PIPL&#8221;) in China, and new and emerging state laws in the United States on privacy, data and related technologies, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act, the California Privacy Rights Act and the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, as well as industry self-regulatory codes, create new compliance obligations and expand the scope of potential liability, either jointly or severally with our customers and suppliers.",Legal Risk
"While we have invested in readiness to comply with applicable requirements, the dynamic and evolving nature of these laws, regulations and codes, as well as their interpretation by regulators and courts, may affect our ability (and our enterprise customers&#8217; ability) to reach current and prospective customers, to respond to both enterprise and individual customer requests under the laws (such as individual rights of access, correction and deletion of their personal information) and to implement our business models effectively.",Legal Risk
"These laws, regulations and codes may also impact our innovation and business drivers in developing new and emerging technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence and machine learning).",Legal Risk
"These requirements, among others, may impact demand for our offerings and force us to bear the burden of more onerous obligations in our contracts.",Market Risk
"Any perception of our practices, products or services as a violation of individual privacy or data protection rights may subject us to public criticism, class action lawsuits, reputational harm, or investigations or claims by regulators, industry groups or other third parties, all of which could disrupt or adversely impact our business and expose us to increased liability.",Legal Risk
"Additionally, we collect and store information on behalf of our business customers and if our customers fail to comply with contractual obligations or applicable laws, it could result in litigation or reputational harm to us.",Legal Risk
"Transferring personal information across international borders is complex and subject to legal and regulatory requirements as well as active litigation and enforcement in a number of jurisdictions around the world, each of which could have an adverse impact on our ability to process and transfer personal data as part of our business operations.",Legal Risk
"For example, European data transfers outside the European Economic Area are highly regulated and litigated.",Legal Risk
"The mechanisms that we and many other companies rely upon for European data transfers (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses) are the subject of regulatory interpretation and judicial decisions by the Court of Justice of the European Union.",Legal Risk
We are closely monitoring for developments related to valid transfer mechanisms available for transferring personal data outside the European Economic Area (including the Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework) and other countries that have similar trans-border data flow requirements and adjusting our practices accordingly.,Legal Risk
The open judicial questions and regulatory interpretations related to the validity of transfers using Standard Contractual Clauses have resulted in some changes in the obligations required to provide our services in the European Union and could expose us to potential sanctions and fines for non-compliance.,Legal Risk
"Several other countries, including China, Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, Hong Kong and Japan, have also established specific legal requirements for cross-border transfers of personal information and for data localization (i.e., where personal data must remain stored in the country).",Legal Risk
"If other countries implement more restrictive regulations for cross-border data transfers or do not permit data to leave the country of origin, such developments could adversely impact our business and our enterprise customers&#8217; business, our financial condition and our results of operations in those jurisdictions.",Business Risk
"Our intellectual property portfolio is a valuable asset and we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights, including our source code, from infringement or unauthorized copying, use or disclosure.",Legal Risk
Our intellectual property portfolio is a valuable asset.,Technology Risk
"Infringement or misappropriation of our patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and other intellectual property rights could result in lost revenues and ultimately reduce their value.",Legal Risk
Preventing unauthorized use or infringement of our intellectual property rights is inherently difficult.,Legal Risk
"We actively combat software piracy as we enforce our intellectual property rights, but we nonetheless lose significant revenue due to illegal use of our software.",Business Risk
"If piracy activities continue at historical levels or increase, they may further harm our business.",Business Risk
"We apply for patents in the United States and internationally to protect our newly created technology and if we are unable to obtain patent protection for the technology described in our pending patent, or if the patent is not obtained timely, this could result in revenue loss, or have other adverse effects on operations and harm our business.",Technology Risk
"We offer our products and services in foreign countries 

and we may seek intellectual property protection from those foreign legal systems.",Legal Risk
"Some of those foreign countries may not have as robust or comprehensive of intellectual property protection laws and schemes as those offered in the United States, and the mechanisms to enforce intellectual property rights may be inadequate to protect our technology, which could harm our business.",Legal Risk
"We also seek to protect our confidential information and trade secrets through the use of non-disclosure agreements with our customers, contractors, vendors and partners.",Security Risk
"However, there is a risk that our confidential information and trade secrets may be disclosed or published without our authorization, and in these situations, enforcing our rights may be difficult or costly.",Security Risk
"If unauthorized disclosure of our source code occurs through security breach, cyber-attack or otherwise, we could lose future trade secret protection for that source code.",Security Risk
"Such loss could make it easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality, which could cause us to lose customers and could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins.",Business Risk
We may incur substantial costs defending against third parties alleging that we infringe their proprietary rights.,Legal Risk
"We have been, are currently and may in the future be subject to claims, negotiations and complex, protracted litigation relating to disputes regarding the validity or alleged infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, including patent rights.",Legal Risk
Intellectual property disputes and litigation are typically costly and can be disruptive to our business operations by diverting the attention of management and key personnel.,Legal Risk
We may not prevail in every lawsuit or dispute.,Legal Risk
"Third-party intellectual property disputes, including those initiated by patent assertion entities, could subject us to significant liabilities, require us to enter into royalty and licensing arrangements on unfavorable terms, prevent us from offering certain products or services, subject us to injunctions restricting our sales, cause severe disruptions to our operations or the markets in which we compete, or require us to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers, including contractual provisions under various license arrangements and service agreements.",Legal Risk
"In addition, we may incur significant costs in acquiring the necessary third-party intellectual property rights for use in our products, in some cases to fulfill contractual obligations with our customers.",Legal Risk
Any of these occurrences could significantly harm our business.,Business Risk
Changes in accounting principles or interpretations thereof could have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations.,Financial Risk
We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;).,Financial Risk
These principles are subject to interpretation by the SEC and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles.,Financial Risk
"A change in these principles, how the principles are interpreted, or the adoption of new accounting standards can have a significant effect on our reported results, could retroactively affect previously reported transactions and may require that we make significant changes to our systems, processes and controls.",Financial Risk
"Changes resulting from these new standards may result in materially different financial results and may require that we change how we process, analyze and report financial information and that we change financial reporting controls.",Financial Risk
"For additional information regarding new standards that may have significant impact to our consolidated financial statements, see the section titled &#8220;Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Effective&#8221; in Note 1 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.",Financial Risk
"Such changes in accounting principles may have an adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations, or cause an adverse deviation from our revenue and profitability targets, which may negatively impact our financial results.",Financial Risk
Changes in tax rules and regulations or interpretations thereof may adversely affect our effective tax rates.,Legal Risk
We are a United States-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple domestic and foreign tax jurisdictions.,Legal Risk
Significant judgment is required in determining our current provision for income taxes and deferred tax assets or liabilities.,Financial Risk
Tax laws in the United States and in foreign tax jurisdictions are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations are issued.,Legal Risk
The applicability and impact of changes in tax laws and interpretations thereof could adversely affect our effective income tax rate and cash flows in future years.,Legal Risk
Unanticipated changes in our tax rates could affect our future results of operations.,Business Risk
"Our future effective tax rates are likely to be unfavorably affected by changes in the tax rates in jurisdictions where our income is earned, changes in jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in or interpretation of tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business, or unexpected negative changes in business and market conditions that could reduce certain tax benefits.",Business Risk
"In addition, the United States and other countries and jurisdictions in which we conduct business, including those covered by governing bodies that enact tax laws applicable to us, such as the European Commission of the European Union, 

could make changes to relevant tax, accounting or other laws and interpretations thereof that have a material impact to us.",Legal Risk
"These countries, governmental bodies and intergovernmental economic organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, have or could make unprecedented assertions about how taxation is determined and, in some cases, have proposed or enacted new laws that are contrary to the way in which rules and regulations have historically been interpreted and applied.",Legal Risk
"In the current global tax policy environment, any changes in laws, regulations and interpretations could adversely affect our effective tax rates, cause us to respond by making changes to our business structure, or result in other costs to us which could adversely affect our operations and financial results.",Business Risk
"Moreover, we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by domestic and foreign tax authorities.",Legal Risk
We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from these examinations.,Financial Risk
"We believe our tax estimates to be reasonable; however, we cannot provide assurance that the final determination of any of these examinations will not have an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.",Financial Risk
Contracting with government entities exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government procurement process.,Security Risk
"We provide products and services, directly and indirectly, to a variety of domestic and foreign government entities, which introduces certain risks, including extended sales and collection cycles, varying governmental budgeting processes and adherence to complex procurement regulations and other government-specific contractual requirements.",Business Risk
"We have been, are currently and may in the future be subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts and any violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, payment of fines and suspension or debarment from future government business, as well as harm to our reputation and financial results.",Legal Risk
"Risks Related to Financial Performance 

If our customers fail to renew subscriptions in accordance with our expectations, our future revenue and operating results could suffer, and our subscription offerings may create additional risk related to the timing of revenue recognition.",Financial Risk
"Our offerings are typically subscription-based, pursuant to product and service agreements.",General Risk
"Since our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our services after the expiration of their initial subscription period, which typically ranges from 1 to 36 months, our customers may not renew their subscriptions at the same or a higher level of service, for the same number of seats or for the same duration of time, if at all.",Market Risk
Our varied customer base and flexible duration complicates our ability to precisely forecast renewal rates.,Market Risk
"Our customers&#8217; renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including their level of satisfaction with our services, our ability to continue enhancing features and functionality, the reliability (including uptime) of our subscription offerings, the prices of offerings and competitors&#8217; offerings, the actual or perceived information security of our systems and services, decreases in the size of our customer base, reductions in our customers&#8217; spending levels or declines in customer activity as a result of general economic conditions or uncertainty in financial markets, including as a result of a global health crisis and geopolitical conflict, which has affected and may continue to affect certain sectors of the economy disproportionately.",Security Risk
"If our customers do not renew their subscriptions or if they renew on terms less favorable to us, our revenue may decline.",Business Risk
We generally recognize revenue from our subscription offerings ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements.,Market Risk
"As a result, most of the subscription revenue we report in each quarter is the result of subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters.",Market Risk
Any reduction in new or renewed subscriptions in a quarter may not be reflected in our revenue results until a later quarter and may decrease our revenue in future quarters.,Business Risk
"Lower sales, reduced demand for our products and services and increases in our attrition rate may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods.",Business Risk
"Our subscription model could also make it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue from subscription-based or hosted services through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers will be recognized over the applicable subscription term.",Market Risk
"Additionally, in connection with our sales efforts to enterprise customers, a number of factors could affect our revenue, including longer-than-expected sales and implementation cycles, potential deferral of revenue and alternative licensing arrangements.",Business Risk
"If any of our assumptions about revenue from our subscription-based offerings prove incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from those anticipated.",Business Risk
We may incur losses associated with currency fluctuations and may not be able to effectively hedge our exposure.,Financial Risk
Our operating results are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates due to the global scope of our business.,Business Risk
"Geopolitical and economic events, including war, trade disputes, economic sanctions and emerging market volatility, and associated uncertainty have caused, and may in the future cause, currencies to fluctuate.",Market Risk
"We attempt to mitigate a portion of these risks through foreign currency hedging based on our judgment of the appropriate trade-offs among risk, opportunity and expense.",Financial Risk
We regularly review our hedging program and make adjustments that we believe are appropriate.,Financial Risk
"Our hedging 

activities have not and may not in the future offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates, which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.",Financial Risk

Set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the SEC are descriptions of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report.",Market Risk
"Risks Related to our Business and Industry 

Our operating results may fluctuate in future periods, which may adversely affect our stock price.",Business Risk
"Our operating results have been in the past, and will continue to be, subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations as a result of numerous factors, some of which may contribute to more pronounced fluctuations in an uncertain global economic environment.",Market Risk
"These factors include: 

&#8226; Fluctuations in demand for our products and services, especially with respect to service providers and Internet businesses, in part due to changes in the global economic environment 

&#8226; Changes in sales and implementation cycles for our products and reduced visibility into our customers&#8217; spending plans and associated revenue 

&#8226; Our ability to maintain appropriate inventory levels and purchase commitments 

&#8226; Price and product competition in the communications and networking industries, which can change rapidly due to technological innovation and different business models from various geographic regions 

&#8226; The overall movement toward industry consolidation among both our competitors and our customers 

&#8226; The introduction and market acceptance of new technologies and products, and our success in new and evolving markets, and in emerging technologies, as well as the adoption of new standards 

&#8226; The transformation of our business to deliver more software and subscription offerings where revenue is recognized over time 

&#8226; Variations in sales channels, product costs, mix of products sold, or mix of direct sales and indirect sales 

&#8226; The timing, size, and mix of orders from customers 

&#8226; Manufacturing and customer lead times 

&#8226; Fluctuations in our gross margins, and the factors that contribute to such fluctuations 

&#8226; The ability of our customers, channel partners, contract manufacturers and suppliers to obtain financing or to fund capital expenditures, especially during a period of global credit market disruption or in the event of customer, channel partner, contract manufacturer or supplier financial problems 

&#8226; Actual events, circumstances, outcomes, and amounts differing from judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in determining the values of certain assets (including the amounts of related valuation allowances), liabilities, and other items reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements 

&#8226; How well we execute on our strategy and operating plans and the impact of changes in our business model that could result in significant restructuring charges 

&#8226; Our ability to achieve targeted cost reductions 

&#8226; Benefits anticipated from our investments 

&#8226; Changes in tax laws or accounting rules, or interpretations thereof 

As a consequence, operating results for a particular future period are difficult to predict, and, therefore, prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods.",Market Risk
"Any of the foregoing factors, or any other factors discussed elsewhere herein, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition that could adversely affect our stock price.",Financial Risk
Our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions and the uncertain geopolitical environment.,Business Risk
"Challenging economic conditions, including rising inflation, or other changes, worldwide have from time to time contributed, and may continue to contribute, to slowdowns in the communications and networking industries at large, as well as in specific segments and markets in which we operate, resulting in: reduced demand for our products as a result of continued constraints on IT-related capital spending by our customers, particularly service providers, and other customer markets as well; increased price competition for our products, not only from our competitors but also as a consequence of customers disposing of unutilized products; risk of excess and obsolete inventories; risk of supply constraints; risk of excess facilities and manufacturing capacity; and higher overhead costs as a percentage of revenue and higher interest expense.",Market Risk
The global macroeconomic environment continues to be challenging and inconsistent.,Market Risk
"In certain prior periods, we have seen a broad-based weakening in the global macroeconomic environment which has impacted and could impact in the future certain of our markets.",Market Risk
"Additionally, instability in the global credit markets, the impact of uncertainty regarding global central bank monetary policy, the instability in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world (including as a result of the on-going Russia and Ukraine war, and China-Taiwan relations), the current economic challenges in China, including global economic ramifications of Chinese economic difficulties, and other disruptions may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions.",Market Risk
"If global economic and market conditions, or economic conditions in key markets, remain uncertain or deteriorate further, we may experience material impacts on our business, operating results, and financial condition.",Market Risk
Our operating results in one or more segments may also be affected by uncertain or changing economic conditions particularly germane to that segment or to particular customer markets within that segment.,Market Risk
"In addition, reports of certain intelligence gathering methods of the U.S. government could affect customers&#8217; perception of the products of IT companies which design and manufacture products in the United States.",Market Risk
Trust and confidence in us as an IT supplier are critical to the development and growth of our markets.,Technology Risk
"Impairment of that trust, or foreign regulatory actions taken in response to reports of certain intelligence gathering methods of the U.S. government, could affect the demand for our products from customers outside of the United States and could have an adverse effect on our operating results.",Security Risk
"Our revenue for a particular period is difficult to predict, and a shortfall in revenue may harm our operating results.",Business Risk
"As a result of a variety of factors discussed in this report, our revenue for a particular quarter is difficult to predict, especially in light of a challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic environment (including as a result of the on-going Russia and Ukraine war), and related market uncertainty.",Market Risk
"Our revenue may grow at a slower rate than in past periods, or decline as it did in certain prior periods.",Market Risk
Our ability to meet financial expectations could also be adversely affected if the nonlinear sales pattern seen in some of our past quarters recurs in future periods.,Financial Risk
"We have experienced periods of time during which shipments have exceeded net bookings or manufacturing issues have delayed shipments, leading to nonlinearity in shipping patterns.",Market Risk
"In addition to making it difficult to predict revenue for a particular period, nonlinearity in shipping can increase costs, because irregular shipment patterns result in periods of underutilized capacity and periods in which overtime expenses may be incurred, as well as in potential additional inventory management-related costs.",Business Risk
"In addition, to the extent that manufacturing issues and any related component shortages result in delayed shipments in the future, and particularly in periods in which our contract manufacturers are operating at higher levels of capacity, it is possible that revenue for a quarter could be adversely affected if such matters occur and are not remediated within the same quarter.",Business Risk
The timing of large orders can also have a significant effect on our business and operating results from quarter to quarter.,Business Risk
"From time to time, we receive large orders that have a significant effect on our operating results in the period in which the order is recognized as revenue.",Business Risk
"The timing of such orders is difficult to predict, and the timing of revenue recognition from such orders may affect period to period changes in revenue.",Market Risk
"As a result, our operating results could vary materially from quarter to quarter based on the receipt of such orders and their ultimate recognition as revenue.",Business Risk
"Longer than normal manufacturing lead times in the past have caused, and in the future could cause, some customers to place the same or a similar order multiple times within our various sales channels and to cancel the duplicative orders upon shipment or receipt of the product, or to also place orders with other vendors with shorter manufacturing lead times.",Business Risk
Such multiple ordering (along with other factors) or risk of order cancellation may cause difficulty in predicting our revenue.,Business Risk
"Further, our efforts to improve manufacturing lead-time performance may result in more variability and less predictability in our revenue and operating results.",Business Risk
"In addition, when facing component supply-related challenges, we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations, which in turn contribute to an increase in inventory and purchase commitments.",Market Risk
"In prior periods, we increased our inventory and purchase commitments in light of the significant supply constraints seen industry-wide due to component shortages.",Market Risk
These increases in our inventory and purchase commitments to shorten lead times could also lead to material excess and obsolete inventory charges or other negative impacts to our product gross margin in future periods if product demand significantly weakens for a sustained duration.,Business Risk
We plan our operating expense levels based primarily on forecasted revenue levels.,General Risk
These expenses and the impact of long-term commitments are relatively fixed in the short term.,Financial Risk
A shortfall in revenue could lead to operating results being below expectations because we may not be able to quickly reduce these fixed expenses in response to short-term business changes.,Business Risk
Any of the above factors could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial results.,Financial Risk
"For additional information and a further discussion of impacts and risks related to our supply constraints, inventory commitments and our purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, see Results of Operations&#8212;Product Gross Margin&#8212;Supply Constraints Impacts and Risks, Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8212;Inventory Supply Chain and Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.",Business Risk
"Supply chain issues, including financial problems of contract manufacturers or component suppliers, or a shortage of adequate component supply or manufacturing capacity that increase our costs or cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders, could have an adverse impact on our business and operating results, and our failure to estimate customer demand properly may result in excess or obsolete component supply, which could adversely affect our gross margins.",Business Risk
The fact that we do not own or operate the bulk of our manufacturing facilities and that we are reliant on our extended supply chain could have an adverse impact on the supply of our products and on our business and operating results.,Business Risk
"Financial problems of either contract manufacturers or component suppliers, reservation of manufacturing capacity at our contract manufacturers by other companies, and industry consolidation occurring within one or more component supplier markets, such as the semiconductor market, in each case, could either limit supply or increase costs.",Financial Risk
"A reduction or interruption in supply, including disruptions on our global supply chain, caused in part by public health emergencies, geopolitical tensions (including as a result of China-Taiwan relations) or a significant natural disaster (including as a result of climate change); a significant increase in the price of one or more components (including as a result of inflation); a failure to adequately authorize procurement of inventory by our contract manufacturers; a failure to appropriately cancel, reschedule, or adjust our requirements based on our business needs; or a decrease in demand for our products could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition and could materially damage customer relationships.",Business Risk
"Furthermore, as a result of binding price or purchase commitments with suppliers, we may be obligated to purchase components at prices that are higher than those available in the current market.",Market Risk
"In the event that we become committed to purchase components at prices in excess of the current market price when the components are actually used, our gross margins could decrease.",Market Risk
"In addition, vendors may be under pressure to allocate product to certain customers for business, regulatory or political reasons, and/or demand changes in agreed pricing as a condition of supply.",Market Risk
"Although we have generally secured additional supply or taken other mitigation actions when significant disruptions have occurred, if similar situations occur in the future, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.",Business Risk
Our growth and ability to meet customer demands depend in part on our ability to obtain timely deliveries of parts from our suppliers and contract manufacturers.,Market Risk
"We have experienced component shortages in the past, including shortages caused by manufacturing process issues, that have affected our operations, including longer than normal lead times.",Business Risk
"For example, in recent periods, there was a market shortage of semiconductor and other component supply which affected lead times, the cost of that supply, and our ability to meet customer demand for our products.",Market Risk
"While supply constraints remain, we saw an overall improvement of such constraints in fiscal 2023.",Market Risk
"Additionally, we may in the future experience a shortage of certain component parts as a result of our own manufacturing issues, manufacturing issues at our suppliers or contract manufacturers, capacity problems experienced by our suppliers or contract manufacturers including capacity or cost problems resulting from industry consolidation, or strong demand for those parts.",Business Risk
"Growth in the economy is likely to create greater pressures on us and our suppliers to accurately project overall component demand and component demands within specific product categories and to establish optimal component levels and manufacturing capacity, especially for labor-intensive components, components for which we purchase a substantial portion of the supply, or the re-ramping of manufacturing capacity for highly complex products.",Market Risk
"During periods of shortages or delays the price of components may increase, or the components may not be available at all, and we may also encounter shortages if we do not accurately anticipate our needs.",Market Risk
We may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build new products in a timely manner in the quantities or configurations needed.,Business Risk
"Accordingly, our revenue and gross margins could suffer until other sources can be developed.",Business Risk
"Our operating results would also be adversely affected if, anticipating greater demand than actually develops, we commit to the purchase of more components than we need, which is more likely to occur during periods of demand uncertainties such as we have experienced in recent periods and expect to continue to experience over the short- and medium-term.",Business Risk
"Although in many cases we use standard parts and components for our products, certain components are presently available only from a single source or limited sources, and a global economic downturn and related market uncertainty could negatively impact the availability of components from one or more of these sources, especially during times such as we have recently seen when there are supplier constraints based on labor and other actions taken during economic downturns.",Market Risk
"We may not be able to diversify sources in a timely manner, which could harm our ability to deliver products to customers and seriously impact present and future sales.",Business Risk
"We believe that we may be faced with the following challenges in the future: new markets in which we participate may grow quickly, which may make it difficult to quickly obtain significant component capacity; as we acquire companies and new technologies, we may be dependent on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners; and we face competition for certain components that are supply-constrained, from existing competitors, and companies in other markets.",Business Risk
Manufacturing capacity and component supply constraints could continue to be significant issues for us.,Market Risk
We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products.,Market Risk
"During the normal course of business, in order to improve manufacturing lead-time performance and to help ensure adequate component supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that either allow them to 

procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements.",General Risk
"In certain instances, these agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed.",Business Risk
"When facing component supply-related challenges we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations, which in turn contributes to an increase in inventory and purchase commitments.",Market Risk
"In past periods, we increased our inventory and purchase commitments in light of the supply constraints seen industry-wide due to component shortages.",Market Risk
These increases in our inventory and purchase commitments to shorten lead times could also lead to material excess and obsolete inventory charges or other negative impacts to our product gross margin in future periods if we fail to anticipate customer demand properly and product demand significantly weakens for a sustained duration.,Business Risk
"For additional information and a further discussion of impacts and risks related to our supply constraints, inventory commitments and our purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, see Results of Operations&#8212;Product Gross Margin&#8212;Supply Constraints Impacts and Risks, Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8212;Inventory Supply Chain and Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.",Business Risk
"We expect gross margin to vary over time, and our level of product gross margin may not be sustainable.",Business Risk
"Although our product gross margin increased in fiscal 2023, our level of product gross margins declined in fiscal 2022 and have declined in certain prior periods on a year-over-year basis, and could decline in future periods due to adverse impacts from various factors, including: 

&#8226; Changes in customer, geographic, or product mix, including mix of configurations within each product group 

&#8226; Introduction of new products, including products with price-performance advantages, and new business models including the transformation of our business to deliver more software and subscription offerings 

&#8226; Our ability to reduce production costs 

&#8226; Entry into new markets or growth in lower margin markets, including markets with different pricing and cost structures, through acquisitions or internal development 

&#8226; Sales discounts 

&#8226; Increases in material, labor or other manufacturing-related costs (i.e.",Business Risk
"component costs, broker fees, expedited freight and overtime) or higher supply chain logistics costs, any of which could be significant, especially during periods of supply constraints for certain costs, such as those that have impacted the market for components, including semiconductors and memory in past periods, and which costs have in the past and may continue to be exacerbated by inflation 

&#8226; Excess inventory, inventory holding charges, and obsolescence charges 

&#8226; Changes in shipment volume 

&#8226; The timing of revenue recognition and revenue deferrals 

&#8226; Increased costs (including those caused by tariffs or economic conditions, including inflation), loss of cost savings or dilution of savings due to changes in component pricing or charges incurred due to inventory holding periods if parts ordering does not correctly anticipate product demand or if the financial health of either contract manufacturers or suppliers deteriorates 

&#8226; Lower than expected benefits from value engineering 

&#8226; Increased price competition, including competitors from Asia, especially from China 

&#8226; Changes in distribution channels 

&#8226; Increased warranty or royalty costs 

&#8226; Increased amortization of purchased intangible assets, especially from acquisitions 

&#8226; How well we execute on our strategy and operating plans 

Changes in service gross margin may result from various factors such as changes in the mix between technical support services and advanced services, as well as the timing of technical support service contract initiations and renewals and the addition of personnel and other resources to support higher levels of service business in future periods.",Market Risk
"Sales to the service provider market are especially volatile, and weakness in orders from this industry may harm our operating results and financial condition.",Market Risk
"Sales to the service provider market have been characterized by large and sporadic purchases, especially relating to our router sales and sales of certain other Secure, Agile Networks and Collaboration products, in addition to longer sales cycles.",Market Risk
Service provider product orders significantly decreased during fiscal 2023 and we have experienced similar weakness in certain prior periods.,Market Risk
"Product orders from the service provider market could continue to decline and, as has been the case in the past, such weakness could persist over extended periods of time given fluctuating market conditions.",Market Risk
"Sales activity in this industry 

depends upon the stage of completion of expanding network infrastructures; the availability of funding; and the extent to which service providers are affected by regulatory, economic, and business conditions in the country of operations.",Market Risk
"Weakness in orders from this industry, including as a result of any slowdown in capital expenditures by service providers (which may be more prevalent during a global economic downturn, or periods of economic, political or regulatory uncertainty), could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.",Business Risk
Such slowdowns may continue or recur in future periods.,Market Risk
Orders from this industry could decline for many reasons other than the competitiveness of our products and services within their respective markets.,Market Risk
"For example, in the past, many of our service provider customers have been materially and adversely affected by slowdowns in the general economy, by overcapacity, by changes in the service provider market, by regulatory developments, and by constraints on capital availability, resulting in business failures and substantial reductions in spending and expansion plans.",Business Risk
"These conditions have materially harmed our business and operating results in the past, and could affect our business and operating results in any future period.",Business Risk
"Finally, service provider customers typically have longer implementation cycles; require a broader range of services, including design services; demand that vendors take on a larger share of risks; often require acceptance provisions, which can lead to a delay in revenue recognition; and expect financing from vendors.",Financial Risk
All these factors can add further risk to business conducted with service providers.,Business Risk
Disruption of or changes in our distribution model could harm our sales and margins.,Business Risk
"If we fail to manage distribution of our products and services properly, or if our distributors&#8217; financial condition or operations weaken, our revenue and gross margins could be adversely affected.",Business Risk
"A substantial portion of our products and services is sold through our channel partners, and the remainder is sold through direct sales.",Market Risk
"Our channel partners include systems integrators, service providers, other third-party resellers, and distributors.",Market Risk
"Systems integrators and service providers typically sell directly to end users and often provide system installation, technical support, professional services, and other support services in addition to network equipment sales.",Security Risk
"Systems integrators also typically integrate our products into an overall solution, and a number of service providers are also systems integrators.",Security Risk
"Distributors stock inventory and typically sell to systems integrators, service providers, and other third-party resellers.",Market Risk
We refer to sales through distributors as our two-tier system of sales to the end customer.,Technology Risk
"If sales through indirect channels increase, this may lead to greater difficulty in forecasting the mix of our products and, to a degree, the timing of orders from our customers.",Business Risk
"Historically, we have seen fluctuations in our gross margins based on changes in the balance of our distribution channels.",Business Risk
There can be no assurance that changes in the balance of our distribution model in future periods would not have an adverse effect on our gross margins and profitability.,Business Risk
"Some factors could result in disruption of or changes in our distribution model, which could harm our sales and margins, including the following: competition with some of our channel partners, including through our direct sales, which may lead these channel partners to use other suppliers that do not directly sell their own products or otherwise compete with them; some of our channel partners may demand that we absorb a greater share of the risks that their customers may ask them to bear; some of our channel partners may have insufficient financial resources and may not be able to withstand changes and challenges in business conditions; and revenue from indirect sales could suffer if our distributors&#8217; financial condition or operations weaken.",Business Risk
"In addition, we depend on our channel partners globally to comply with applicable regulatory requirements.",Market Risk
"To the extent that they fail to do so, that could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.",Business Risk
"Further, sales of our products outside of agreed territories can result in disruption to our distribution channels.",Business Risk
"The markets in which we compete are intensely competitive, which could adversely affect our achievement of revenue growth.",Business Risk
"The markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid change, converging technologies, and a migration to networking and communications solutions that offer relative advantages.",Technology Risk
These market factors represent a competitive threat to us.,Market Risk
We compete with numerous vendors in each product category.,Market Risk
The overall number of our competitors providing niche product solutions may increase.,Market Risk
"Also, the identity and composition of competitors may change as we increase our activity in newer product areas, and in key priority and growth areas.",Business Risk
"For example, as products related to network programmability, such as software defined networking (SDN) products, have become more prevalent, we have faced increased competition from companies that develop networking products based on commoditized hardware, referred to as &#8220;white box&#8221; hardware, to the extent customers decide to purchase those product offerings instead of ours.",Market Risk
"In addition, the growth in demand for technology delivered as a service enables new competitors to enter the market.",Market Risk
"As we continue to expand globally, we may see new competition in different geographic regions.",Market Risk
"In particular, we have experienced price-focused competition from competitors in Asia, especially from China, and we anticipate this will continue.",Market Risk
"For information regarding our competitors, see the section entitled &#8220;Competition&#8221; contained in Item 1. Business of this report.",Financial Risk
"Some of our competitors compete across many of our product lines, while others are primarily focused in a specific product area.",Financial Risk
"Barriers to entry are relatively low, and new ventures to create products that do or could compete with our products are regularly formed.",Market Risk
"In addition, some of our competitors may have greater resources, including technical and engineering resources, than we do.",Technology Risk
"As we expand into new markets, we will face competition not only from our existing competitors but 

also from other competitors, including existing companies with strong technological, marketing, and sales positions in those markets.",Business Risk
We also sometimes face competition from resellers and distributors of our products.,Market Risk
"Companies with which we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas, and this trend may increase.",Market Risk
"For example, the enterprise data center is undergoing a fundamental transformation arising from the convergence of technologies, including computing, networking, storage, and software, that previously were segregated.",Technology Risk
"Due to several factors, including the availability of highly scalable and general purpose microprocessors, ASICs offering advanced services, standards based protocols, cloud computing and virtualization, the convergence of technologies within the enterprise data center is spanning multiple, previously independent, technology segments.",Technology Risk
"Also, some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data center business have made acquisitions, or announced new strategic alliances, designed to position them to provide end-to-end technology solutions for the enterprise data center.",Market Risk
"As a result of all of these developments, we face greater competition in the development and sale of enterprise data center technologies, including competition from entities that are among our long-term strategic alliance partners.",Technology Risk
"Companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors, thereby reducing their business with us.",Business Risk
"The principal competitive factors in the markets in which we presently compete and may compete in the future include the ability to sell successful business outcomes; the ability to provide a broad range of networking and communications products and services; product performance; price; the ability to introduce new products, including providing continuous new customer value and products with price-performance advantages; the ability to reduce production costs; the ability to provide value-added features such as security, reliability, and investment protection; conformance to standards; market presence; the ability to provide financing; and disruptive technology shifts and new business models.",Security Risk
We also face competition from customers to which we license or supply technology and suppliers from which we transfer technology.,Technology Risk
The inherent nature of networking requires interoperability.,General Risk
"As such, we must cooperate and at the same time compete with many companies.",Market Risk
"Any inability to effectively manage these complicated relationships with customers, suppliers, and strategic alliance partners could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition and accordingly affect our chances of success.",Business Risk
"If we do not successfully manage our strategic alliances, we may not realize the expected benefits from such alliances, and we may experience increased competition or delays in product development.",Business Risk
We have several strategic alliances with large and complex organizations and other companies with which we work to offer complementary products and services.,General Risk
"These arrangements are generally limited to specific projects, the goal of which is generally to facilitate product compatibility and adoption of industry standards.",Financial Risk
There can be no assurance we will realize the expected benefits from these strategic alliances or from joint ventures.,Market Risk
"If successful, these relationships may be mutually beneficial and result in industry growth.",Financial Risk
"However, alliances carry an element of risk because, in most cases, we must compete in some business areas with a company with which we have a strategic alliance and, at the same time, cooperate with that company in other business areas.",Business Risk
"Also, if these companies fail to perform or if these relationships fail to materialize as expected, we could suffer delays in product development or other operational difficulties.",Business Risk
"Joint ventures can be difficult to manage, given the potentially different interests of joint venture partners.",Business Risk
"Inventory management relating to our sales to our two-tier distribution channel is complex, and excess inventory may harm our gross margins.",Business Risk
"We must manage inventory relating to sales to our distributors effectively, because inventory held by them could affect our results of operations.",Business Risk
"Our distributors may increase orders during periods of product shortages, cancel orders if their inventory is too high, or delay orders in anticipation of new products.",Market Risk
"They also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors that are available to them, and in response to seasonal fluctuations in end-user demand.",Market Risk
"Our distributors are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory, receive credits for changes in selling price, and participate in various cooperative marketing programs.",General Risk
Inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements.,Technology Risk
"When facing component supply-related challenges, we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations.",Market Risk
"If we ultimately determine that we have excess inventory, we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory, which in turn could result in lower gross margins.",Business Risk
"We depend upon the development of new products and services, and enhancements to existing products and services, and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers&#8217; changing needs, our operating results and market share may suffer.",Technology Risk
"The markets for our products and services are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, new product and service introductions, and evolving methods of building and operating networks.",Technology Risk
"Our operating results depend on 

our ability to develop and introduce new products and services into existing and emerging markets and to reduce the production costs of existing products.",Technology Risk
If customers do not purchase and/or renew our offerings our business could be harmed.,Business Risk
"The process of developing new technology, including more programmable, flexible and virtual networks, and technology related to other market transitions&#8212; such as security, digital transformation and IoT, and cloud&#8212; is complex and uncertain, and if we fail to accurately predict customers&#8217; changing needs and emerging technological trends our business could be harmed.",Technology Risk
"We must commit significant resources, including the investments we have been making in our strategic priorities to developing new products and services before knowing whether our investments will result in products and services the market will accept.",Market Risk
"In particular, if our model of the evolution of networking does not emerge as we believe it will, or if the industry does not evolve as we believe it will, or if our strategy for addressing this evolution is not successful, many of our strategic initiatives and investments may be of no or limited value.",Technology Risk
"For example, if we do not introduce products related to network programmability, such as software-defined-networking products, in a timely fashion, or if product offerings in this market that ultimately succeed are based on technology, or an approach to technology, that differs from ours, such as, for example, networking products based on &#8220;white box&#8221; hardware, our business could be harmed.",Business Risk
"Similarly, our business could be harmed if we fail to develop, or fail to develop in a timely fashion, offerings to address other transitions, or if the offerings addressing these other transitions that ultimately succeed are based on technology, or an approach to technology, different from ours.",Business Risk
"In addition, our business could be adversely affected in periods surrounding our new product introductions if customers delay purchasing decisions to qualify or otherwise evaluate the new product offerings.",Business Risk
"We have also been transforming our business to move from selling individual products and services to selling products and services integrated into architectures and solutions, and we are seeking to meet the evolving needs of customers which include offering our products and solutions in the manner in which customers wish to consume them.",Market Risk
"As a part of this transformation, we continue to make changes to how we are organized and how we build and deliver our technology, including changes in our business models with customers.",Market Risk
"If our strategy for addressing our customer needs, or the architectures and solutions we develop do not meet those needs, or the changes we are making in how we are organized and how we build and deliver or technology is incorrect or ineffective, our business could be harmed.",Business Risk
"Furthermore, we may not execute successfully on our vision or strategy because of challenges with regard to product planning and timing, technical hurdles that we fail to overcome in a timely fashion, or a lack of appropriate resources.",Business Risk
"This could result in competitors, some of which may also be our strategic alliance partners, providing those solutions before we do and loss of market share, revenue, and earnings.",Business Risk
"In addition, the growth in demand for technology delivered as a service enables new competitors to enter the market.",Market Risk
"The success of new products and services depends on several factors, including proper new product and service definition, component costs, timely completion and introduction of these products and services, differentiation of new products and services from those of our competitors, and market acceptance of these products and services.",Market Risk
"There can be no assurance that we will successfully identify new product and services opportunities, develop and bring new products and services to market in a timely manner, or achieve market acceptance of our products and services or that products, services and technologies developed by others will not render our products, services or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive.",Business Risk
"The products and technologies in our other product categories and key priority and growth areas may not prove to have the market success we anticipate, and we may not successfully identify and invest in other emerging or new products and services.",Market Risk
"Changes in industry structure and market conditions could lead to charges related to discontinuances of certain of our products or businesses, asset impairments and workforce reductions or restructurings.",Market Risk
"In response to changes in industry and market conditions, we may be required to strategically realign our resources and to consider restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise exiting businesses.",Market Risk
"Any resource realignment, or decision to limit investment in or dispose of or otherwise exit businesses, may result in the recording of special charges, such as inventory and technology-related write-offs, workforce reduction or restructuring costs, charges relating to consolidation of excess facilities, or claims from third parties who were resellers or users of discontinued products.",Business Risk
"Our estimates with respect to the useful life or ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of assets, including purchased intangible assets, could change as a result of such assessments and decisions.",Financial Risk
"Although in certain instances our supply agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed, our loss contingencies may include liabilities for contracts that we cannot cancel with contract manufacturers and suppliers.",Business Risk
"Further, our estimates relating to the liabilities for excess facilities are affected by changes in real estate market conditions.",Market Risk
"Additionally, we are required to perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances, and future goodwill impairment tests may result in a charge to earnings.",Financial Risk
"We initiated a restructuring plan in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, for which we expect such plan to be substantially completed by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2024.",Financial Risk
Our business may not be more efficient or effective than prior to implementation of the plan.,Business Risk
"Our restructuring activities, including any related charges and the impact of the related headcount restructurings, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.",Business Risk
"Over the long term we intend to invest in engineering, sales, service and marketing activities, and in key priority and growth areas, and these investments may achieve delayed, or lower than expected, benefits which could harm our operating results.",Business Risk
"While we intend to focus on managing our costs and expenses, over the long term, we also intend to invest in personnel and other resources related to our engineering, sales, service and marketing functions as we realign and dedicate resources on key priority and growth areas.",Market Risk
We also intend to focus on maintaining leadership in core networking and services.,Market Risk
"We are likely to recognize the costs associated with these investments earlier than some of the anticipated benefits, and the return on these investments may be lower, or may develop more slowly, than we expect.",Financial Risk
"If we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments (including if our selection of areas for investment does not play out as we expect), or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed, our operating results may be adversely affected.",Business Risk
We have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions that could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results.,Business Risk
"Our growth depends upon market growth, our ability to enhance our existing products, and our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis.",General Risk
"We intend to continue to address the need to develop new products and enhance existing products through acquisitions of other companies, product lines, technologies, and personnel.",Market Risk
"Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following: 

&#8226; Difficulties or delays in integrating the operations (including IT security), systems, technologies, products, and personnel of the acquired companies, particularly with companies that have large and widespread operations and/or complex products 

&#8226; Diversion of management&#8217;s attention from normal daily operations of the business and the challenges of managing larger and more widespread operations resulting from acquisitions 

&#8226; Potential difficulties in completing projects associated with in-process research and development intangibles 

&#8226; Difficulties in entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions 

&#8226; Initial dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners 

&#8226; Insufficient revenue to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions 

&#8226; The potential loss of key employees, customers, distributors, vendors and other business partners of the companies we acquire following and continuing after announcement of acquisition plans 

Acquisitions may also cause us to: 

&#8226; Issue common stock that would dilute our current stockholders&#8217; percentage ownership 

&#8226; Use a substantial portion of our cash resources, or incur debt 

&#8226; Significantly increase our interest expense, leverage and debt service requirements if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition 

&#8226; Assume liabilities 

&#8226; Record goodwill and intangible assets that are subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges 

&#8226; Incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets 

&#8226; Incur tax expenses related to the effect of acquisitions on our legal structure 

&#8226; Incur large write-offs and restructuring and other related expenses 

&#8226; Become subject to intellectual property or other litigation 

Mergers and acquisitions of high-technology companies are inherently risky and subject to many factors outside of our control, and no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition.",Business Risk
Failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions could materially harm our business and operating results.,Business Risk
"Prior acquisitions have resulted in a wide range of outcomes, from successful introduction of new products and technologies to a failure to do so.",Market Risk
"Even when an acquired company has already developed and marketed products, there can be no assurance that product enhancements will be made in a timely fashion or that pre-acquisition due diligence will have identified all possible issues that might arise with respect to such products.",Business Risk
"In addition, our effective tax rate for future periods is uncertain and could be impacted by mergers and acquisitions.",Business Risk
Risks related to new product development also apply to acquisitions.,Technology Risk
Entrance into new or developing markets exposes us to additional competition and will likely increase demands on our service and support operations.,Business Risk
"As we focus on new market opportunities and key priority and growth areas, we compete with large telecommunications and other equipment suppliers as well as startup companies.",Technology Risk
"Several of our competitors may have greater resources, including technical and engineering resources, than we do.",Market Risk
"Additionally, as customers in these markets complete infrastructure deployments, they may require greater levels of service, support, and financing than we have provided in the past, especially in emerging countries.",Market Risk
"Demand for these types of service, support, or financing contracts may increase in the future.",Market Risk
"There can be no assurance that we can provide products, service, support, and financing to effectively compete for these market opportunities.",Market Risk
"Further, entry into other markets has subjected and will subject us to additional risks, particularly to those markets, including the effects of general market conditions and reduced consumer confidence.",General Risk
"For example, as we add direct selling capabilities globally to meet changing customer demands, we will face increased legal and regulatory requirements.",Legal Risk
"Product quality problems could lead to reduced revenue, gross margins, and net income.",Business Risk
"We produce highly complex products that incorporate leading-edge technology, including both hardware and software.",Security Risk
Software typically contains bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with expected operations.,Security Risk
"There can be no assurance that our pre-shipment testing programs will be adequate to detect all defects, either ones in individual products or ones that could affect numerous shipments, which might interfere with customer satisfaction, reduce sales opportunities, or affect gross margins.",Business Risk
"From time to time, we have had to replace certain components and provide remediation in response to the discovery of defects or bugs in products that we had shipped.",Business Risk
"There can be no assurance that such remediation, depending on the product involved, would not have a material impact.",Market Risk
"An inability to cure a product defect could result in the failure of a product line, temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market, damage to our reputation, inventory costs, or product reengineering expenses, any of which could have a material impact on our revenue, margins, and net income.",Business Risk
"Due to the global nature of our operations, political or economic changes or other factors in a specific country or region could harm our operating results and financial condition.",Business Risk
We conduct significant sales and customer support operations in countries around the world.,Market Risk
"As such, our growth depends in part on our increasing sales into emerging countries.",Business Risk
"We also depend on non-U.S. operations of our contract manufacturers, component suppliers and distribution partners.",Business Risk
Our business in emerging countries in the aggregate experienced a decline in orders in certain prior periods.,Business Risk
We continue to assess the sustainability of any improvements in our business in these countries and there can be no assurance that our investments in these countries will be successful.,Business Risk
"Our future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of political, economic or other factors relating to our operations inside and outside the United States, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition, including the following: impacts from global central bank monetary policy; issues related to the political relationship between the United States and other countries that can affect regulatory matters, affect the willingness of customers in those countries to purchase products from companies headquartered in the United States or affect our ability to procure components if a government body were to deny us access to those components; government-related disruptions or shutdowns; the challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic environment; foreign currency exchange rates; geopolitical tensions (including China-Taiwan relations); political or social unrest; economic instability or weakness or natural disasters in a specific country or region, including economic challenges in China and global economic ramifications of Chinese economic difficulties; environmental protection regulations (including new laws and regulations related to climate change); trade protection measures such as tariffs, and other legal and regulatory requirements, some of which may affect our ability to import our products to, export our products from, or sell our products in various countries or affect our ability to procure components; political considerations that affect service provider and government spending patterns; health or similar issues, including pandemics or epidemics; difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; and adverse tax consequences, including imposition of withholding or other taxes on our global operations.",Business Risk
"Issues related to the development and use of artificial intelligence (AI) could give rise to legal and/or regulatory action, damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm of our business.",Technology Risk
We currently incorporate AI technology in certain of our products and services and in our business operations.,Technology Risk
Our research and development of such technology remains ongoing.,Security Risk
"AI presents risks, challenges, and unintended consequences that could affect our and our customers&#8217; adoption and use of this technology.",Technology Risk
AI algorithms and training methodologies may be flawed.,Technology Risk
"Additionally, AI technologies are complex and rapidly evolving, and we face significant competition in the market and from other companies regarding such technologies.",Technology Risk
"While we aim to develop and use AI responsibly and attempt to identify and mitigate ethical and legal issues presented by its use, we may be unsuccessful in identifying or resolving issues before they arise.",Technology Risk
"AI-related issues, deficiencies and/or failures could (i) give rise to legal and/or regulatory action, including with respect to proposed legislation regulating AI in jurisdictions such as the European Union and others, and as a result of new applications of 

existing data protection, privacy, intellectual property, and other laws; (ii) damage our reputation; or (iii) otherwise materially harm our business.",Legal Risk
"We are exposed to the credit risk of some of our customers and to credit exposures in weakened markets, which could result in material losses.",Market Risk
"Most of our sales are on an open credit basis, with typical payment terms of 30 days in the United States, and, because of local customs or conditions, longer in some markets outside the United States.",Financial Risk
"Beyond our open credit arrangements, we have also experienced demands for customer financing and facilitation of leasing arrangements.",Market Risk
Our loan financing arrangements may include not only financing the acquisition of our products and services but also providing additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services.,Financial Risk
Our exposure to the credit risks relating to our financing activities may increase if our customers are adversely affected by a global economic downturn or periods of economic uncertainty.,Financial Risk
There can be no assurance that programs we have in place to monitor and mitigate credit risks will be effective.,Financial Risk
"In the past, there have been significant bankruptcies among customers both on open credit and with loan or lease financing arrangements, particularly among Internet businesses and service providers, causing us to incur economic or financial losses.",Financial Risk
There can be no assurance that additional losses will not be incurred.,Financial Risk
"Although these losses have not been material to date, future losses, if incurred, could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.",Business Risk
"Additionally, to the degree that turmoil in the credit markets makes it more difficult for some customers to obtain financing, those customers&#8217; ability to pay could be adversely impacted, which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.",Market Risk
We are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates; impairment of our investments could harm our earnings.,Market Risk
"We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities.",General Risk
"Our portfolio includes available-for-sale debt investments and equity investments, the values of which are subject to market price volatility.",Market Risk
"If such investments suffer market price declines, as we experienced with some of our investments in the past, we may recognize in earnings the decline in the fair value of our investments below their cost basis.",Market Risk
Our privately held investments are subject to risk of loss of investment capital.,Financial Risk
These investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize.,Market Risk
We could lose our entire investment in these companies.,Market Risk
"For information regarding the market risks associated with the fair value of portfolio investments and interest rates, refer to the section titled &#8220;Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.&#8221; 

We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows.",Market Risk
"Because a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the United States, we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates, including emerging market currencies which can have extreme currency volatility.",Business Risk
An increase in the value of the dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the United States where we sell in dollars and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of raw materials to the extent that we must purchase components in foreign currencies.,Business Risk
"These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve, and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows.",Financial Risk
Failure to retain and recruit key personnel would harm our ability to meet key objectives.,Business Risk
"Our success has always depended in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical, managerial, sales, and marketing personnel.",Market Risk
"Competition for such personnel is intense, especially in the Silicon Valley area of Northern California and other major United States locations.",Market Risk
Stock incentive plans are designed to reward employees for their long-term contributions and provide incentives for them to remain with us.,General Risk
"Volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price or equity incentive awards, or changes to our overall compensation program, including our stock incentive program, resulting from the management of share dilution and share-based compensation expense or otherwise, may also adversely affect our ability to retain key employees.",Market Risk
"As a result of one or more of these factors, we may increase our hiring in geographic areas outside the United States, which could subject us to additional geopolitical and exchange rate risk.",Business Risk
"The loss of services of any of our key personnel; the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future; or delays in hiring required personnel, particularly in engineering and sales fields, could make it difficult to meet key objectives, such as timely and effective product introductions.",Business Risk
"In addition, companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that competitors have engaged in improper hiring practices.",Market Risk
We have received these claims in the past and may receive additional claims to this effect in the future.,Legal Risk
Adverse resolution of litigation or governmental investigations may harm our operating results or financial condition.,Legal Risk
We are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business.,Legal Risk
"Additionally, in connection with the Russia and Ukraine war and our decision to stop business operations and orderly wind down our business in Russia, there are existing claims and lawsuits in Russia, and the potential for future claims and lawsuits in Russia and/or Belarus, related to such decision and related 

trade restrictions and sanctions.",Legal Risk
"In the event of an unfavorable resolution of any of these lawsuits, the potential outcome could include the seizure of our assets in Russia and/or Belarus, which, collectively, represents less than 0.1% of our total assets at the end of fiscal 2023.",Legal Risk
"Litigation can be costly, lengthy, and disruptive to normal business operations.",Legal Risk
"Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict.",Legal Risk
"An unfavorable resolution of lawsuits or governmental investigations could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition.",Legal Risk
"For additional information regarding certain of the matters in which we are involved, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, subsection (f) &#8220;Legal Proceedings.&#8221; 

Our operating results may be adversely affected and damage to our reputation may occur due to production and sale of counterfeit versions of our products.",Legal Risk
"As is the case with leading products around the world, our products are subject to efforts by third parties to produce counterfeit versions of our products.",Market Risk
"While we work diligently with law enforcement authorities in various countries to block the manufacture of counterfeit goods and to interdict their sale, and to detect counterfeit products in customer networks, and have succeeded in prosecuting counterfeiters and their distributors, resulting in fines, imprisonment and restitution to us, there can be no guarantee that such efforts will succeed.",Legal Risk
"While counterfeiters often aim their sales at customers who might not have otherwise purchased our products due to lack of verifiability of origin and service, such counterfeit sales, to the extent they replace otherwise legitimate sales, could adversely affect our operating results.",Business Risk
Changes in our provision for income taxes or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results.,Business Risk
"Our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates; by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; by changes to foreign-derived intangible income, global intangible low-tax income and base erosion and anti-abuse tax laws, regulations, or interpretations thereof; by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives; by transfer pricing adjustments, including the effect of acquisitions on our legal structure; by tax effects of nondeductible compensation; by tax costs related to intercompany realignments; by changes in accounting principles; or by changes in tax laws and regulations, treaties, or interpretations thereof, including changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income, and the foreign tax credit rules.",Financial Risk
Significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attribute prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes.,General Risk
"The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), an international association comprised of 38 countries, including the United States, has made changes and is contemplating additional changes to numerous long-standing tax principles.",General Risk
"There can be no assurance that these changes and any contemplated changes if finalized, once adopted by countries, will not have an adverse impact on our provision for income taxes.",Legal Risk
"Further, as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments, our income in certain countries was subject to reduced tax rates.",Business Risk
Our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes.,Financial Risk
"In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities.",General Risk
We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.,Financial Risk
There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.,Financial Risk
"Our business and operations are especially subject to the risks of earthquakes, floods, and other natural catastrophic events (including as a result of global climate change).",Business Risk
"Our corporate headquarters, including certain of our research and development operations are located in the Silicon Valley area of Northern California, a region known for seismic activity.",Technology Risk
"Additionally, a certain number of our facilities are located near rivers that have experienced flooding in the past.",Business Risk

"We have not to date experienced a material event as a result of these kinds of natural disasters; however, the occurrence of any such event in the future could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.",Business Risk
"Terrorism, war, and other events may harm our business, operating results and financial condition.",Business Risk
"The continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response thereto, or any other current or future acts of terrorism, war (such as the on-going Russia and Ukraine war), and other events (such as economic sanctions and trade restrictions, including those related to the on-going Russia and Ukraine war) may cause further disruptions to the economies of the United States and other countries and create further uncertainties or could otherwise negatively impact our business, operating results, and financial condition.",Security Risk
"Likewise, events such as loss of infrastructure and utilities services such as energy, 

transportation, or telecommunications could have similar negative impacts.",Technology Risk
"To the extent that such disruptions or uncertainties result in delays or cancellations of customer orders or the manufacture or shipment of our products, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.",Business Risk
There can be no assurance that our operating results and financial condition will not be adversely affected by our incurrence of debt.,Financial Risk
"As of the end of fiscal 2023, we have senior unsecured notes outstanding in an aggregate principal amount of $8.5 billion that mature at specific dates from calendar year 2023 through 2040.",Security Risk
"We have also established a commercial paper program under which we may issue short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $10.0 billion.",Market Risk
"We had no commercial paper notes outstanding under this program as of July 29, 2023 .",Financial Risk
There can be no assurance that our incurrence of this debt or any future debt will be a better means of providing liquidity to us than would our use of our existing cash resources.,Financial Risk
"Further, we cannot be assured that our maintenance of this indebtedness or incurrence of future indebtedness will not adversely affect our operating results or financial condition.",Financial Risk
"In addition, changes by any rating agency to our credit rating can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities, as well as the terms upon which we may borrow under our commercial paper program or future debt issuances.",Financial Risk
Our reputation and/or business could be negatively impacted by ESG matters and/or our reporting of such matters.,Business Risk

"These initiatives, goals, or commitments could be difficult to achieve and costly to implement.",Financial Risk
"For example, in September 2021, we announced our goal to achieve net zero across all scopes of greenhouse gas emissions by 2040, the achievement of which relies, in large part, on the accuracy of our estimates and assumptions around the enhanced power efficiency of our products, the adoption of renewable energy at customer and supplier sites, and the adoption of certain of our products and services by our customers.",Market Risk
"We could fail to achieve, or be perceived to fail to achieve, our 2040 net zero goal or other ESG-related initiatives, goals, or commitments.",Market Risk
"In addition, we could be criticized for the timing, scope or nature of these initiatives, goals, or commitments, or for any revisions to them.",General Risk
"To the extent that our required and voluntary disclosures about ESG matters increase, we could be criticized for the accuracy, adequacy, or completeness of such disclosures.",Financial Risk
"Our actual or perceived failure to achieve our ESG-related initiatives, goals, or commitments could negatively impact our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business.",Business Risk
"Risks Related to Intellectual Property 

Our proprietary rights may prove difficult to enforce.",Legal Risk
"We generally rely on patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secret laws to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and products.",Legal Risk
"Although we have been issued numerous patents and other patent applications are currently pending, there can be no assurance that any of these patents or other proprietary rights will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented or that our rights will, in fact, provide competitive advantages to us.",Legal Risk
"Furthermore, many key aspects of networking technology are governed by industrywide standards, which are usable by all market entrants.",General Risk
"In addition, there can be no assurance that patents will be issued from pending applications or that claims allowed on any patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology.",Legal Risk
"In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States.",Legal Risk
The outcome of any actions taken in these foreign countries may be different than if such actions were determined under the laws of the United States.,Legal Risk
"Although we are not dependent on any individual patents or group of patents for particular segments of the business for which we compete, if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights to the totality of the features (including aspects of products protected other than by patent rights) in a market, we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the substantial expense, time, and effort required to create innovative products that have enabled us to be successful.",Legal Risk
We may be found to infringe on intellectual property rights of others.,Legal Risk
"Third parties, including customers, have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent, copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us.",Legal Risk
"These assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions, particularly in the United States.",Legal Risk
"Because of the existence of a large number of patents in the networking field, the secrecy of some pending patents, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is not economically practical or even possible to determine in advance whether a product or any of its components infringes or will infringe on the patent rights of others.",Legal Risk
"The asserted claims and/or initiated litigation can include claims against us or our manufacturers, suppliers, or customers, alleging 

infringement of their proprietary rights with respect to our existing or future products or components of those products.",Legal Risk
"Regardless of the merit of these claims, they can be time-consuming, result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel, or require us to develop a non-infringing technology or enter into license agreements.",Legal Risk
"Where claims are made by customers, resistance even to unmeritorious claims could damage customer relationships.",Market Risk
"There can be no assurance that licenses will be available on acceptable terms and conditions, if at all, or that our indemnification by our suppliers will be adequate to cover our costs if a claim were brought directly against us or our customers.",Legal Risk
"Furthermore, because of the potential for high court awards that are not necessarily predictable, it is not unusual to find even arguably unmeritorious claims settled for significant amounts.",Legal Risk
"If any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful, if we are required to indemnify a customer with respect to a claim against the customer, or if we fail to develop non-infringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.",Legal Risk
"For additional information regarding our indemnification obligations, see Note 14(e) to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report.",Legal Risk
"Our exposure to risks associated with the use of intellectual property may be increased as a result of acquisitions, as we have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to such technology or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks.",Legal Risk
"Further, in the past, third parties have made infringement and similar claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition.",Legal Risk
We rely on the availability of third-party licenses.,Legal Risk
Many of our products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties.,Technology Risk
It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of these products.,Legal Risk
"There can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms, if at all.",Legal Risk
"The inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms, or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.",Legal Risk
"Moreover, the inclusion in our products of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis could limit our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our products.",Legal Risk
"Risks Related to Cybersecurity, Privacy, and Regulatory Requirements 

Cyber attacks, data breaches or other incidents may disrupt our operations, harm our operating results and financial condition, and damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business; and cyber attacks, data breaches or other incidents on our customers&#8217; or third-party providers&#8217; networks, or in cloud-based services provided to, by, or enabled by us, could result in claims of liability against us, give rise to legal and/or regulatory action, damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business.",Security Risk
"We experience cyber attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to our products, services, and IT environment on a regular basis, and we anticipate continuing to be subject to such attempts as cyber attacks become increasingly sophisticated and more difficult to predict and protect against.",Security Risk
"Despite our implementation of security measures, (i) our products and services, and (ii) the servers, data centers, and cloud-based solutions on which our and third-party data is stored or processed (including servers, data centers and cloud-based solutions operated by third parties on which we rely) (collectively, our &#8220;IT environment&#8221;), are vulnerable to cyber attacks, data breaches, malware, inadvertent error, disruptions, tampering or other theft or misuse, including by employees, contingent workers, malicious actors, or nation-states or their agents (which cyber attack or related activity may intensify during periods of diplomatic or armed conflict).",Security Risk
"Further, a cyber attack or other incident could go undetected and persist in our environments for extended periods.",Security Risk
"Cyber-related events have caused, and in the future could result in, compromise to, or the disruption of access to, the operation of our products, services, and IT environment or those of our customers or third-party providers we rely on, or result in confidential information stored on our systems, our customers&#8217; systems, or other third-party systems being improperly accessed, processed, disclosed now or in the future, or be lost or stolen.",Security Risk
"For example, in December 2021, multiple vulnerabilities were reported for the widely used Java logging library, Apache Log4j.",Security Risk
"We reviewed the use of this library within our products and services, its use in our enterprise IT environment, and its use by our third-party providers, and have taken steps to mitigate these vulnerabilities, including by providing security updates for affected products to our customers.",Security Risk
"We have not to date experienced a material event related to a cybersecurity matter; however, the occurrence of any such event in the future could subject us to liability to our customers, data subjects, suppliers, business partners, employees, and others, give rise to legal and/or regulatory action, could damage our reputation or could otherwise materially harm our business, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.",Security Risk
Efforts to limit the ability of malicious actors to disrupt the operations of the Internet or undermine our own security efforts are costly to implement and may not be successful.,Security Risk
"Breaches of security in our customers&#8217; or third-party providers&#8217; networks, in third-party products we use, or in cloud-based services provided to, by, or enabled by us, regardless of whether the breach is attributable to a vulnerability in our products or services, or a failure to maintain the digital security infrastructure or security tools that protect the integrity of our products, services, and IT environment, could, in each case, result in claims of liability against us, damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business.",Security Risk
"Vulnerabilities and critical security defects, prioritization decisions regarding remedying vulnerabilities or security defects, failure of third-party providers to remedy vulnerabilities or security defects, or customers not deploying security updates in a timely manner or deciding not to upgrade products, services or solutions could result in claims of liability against us, damage our reputation, or otherwise materially harm our business.",Security Risk
"The products and services we sell to customers, and our cloud-based solutions, inevitably contain vulnerabilities or security defects which have not been remedied and cannot be disclosed without compromising security.",Security Risk
We also make prioritization decisions in determining which vulnerabilities or security defects to fix and the timing of these fixes.,Security Risk
Customers may also need to test security updates before they can be deployed which can delay implementation.,Security Risk
"When customers do not deploy security updates in a timely manner, or decide not to upgrade to the latest versions of our products, services or cloud-based solutions containing the security update, they may be left vulnerable.",Security Risk
"In addition, we rely on third-party providers of software and cloud-based services on which our and third-party data is stored or processed, and we cannot control the timing at which third-party providers remedy vulnerabilities, which could leave us vulnerable.",Security Risk
"Vulnerabilities and security defects, prioritization errors in remedying vulnerabilities or security defects, failure of third-party providers to remedy vulnerabilities or security defects, or customers not deploying security updates in a timely manner or deciding not to upgrade products, services or solutions could result in claims of liability against us, damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business.",Security Risk
"Our actual or perceived failure to adequately protect personal data could result in claims of liability against us, damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business.",Security Risk
"Global privacy and data protection-related laws and regulations are evolving, extensive, and complex.",Legal Risk
Compliance with these laws and regulations is difficult and costly.,Legal Risk
"In addition, evolving legal requirements restricting or controlling the collection, processing, or cross-border transmission of data, including for regulation of cloud-based services, could materially affect our customers&#8217; ability to use, and our ability to sell, our products and services.",Legal Risk
"The interpretation and application of these laws in some instances is uncertain, and our legal and regulatory obligations are subject to frequent changes.",Legal Risk
"For example, the European Union&#8217;s (&#8220;EU&#8221;) General Data Protection Regulation (&#8220;GDPR&#8221;) applies to our activities conducted from an establishment in the EU or related to products and services offered in the EU and imposes a range of compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data.",Legal Risk
"Additionally, we are subject to California&#8217;s Consumer Privacy Act and other laws, regulations and obligations that relate to the handling of personal data.",Legal Risk
"Our actual or perceived failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or other obligations relating to personal data, or to protect personal data from unauthorized access, use, or other processing, could subject us to liability to our customers, data subjects, suppliers, business partners, employees, and others, give rise to legal and/or regulatory action, could damage our reputation or could otherwise materially harm our business, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.",Legal Risk
"Our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially harmed by evolving regulatory uncertainty or obligations applicable to our products and services.",Business Risk
"Changes in regulatory requirements applicable to the industries and sectors in which we operate, in the United States and in other countries, could materially affect the sales of our products and services.",Business Risk
"In particular, economic sanctions and changes to export and import control requirements have impacted and may continue to impact our ability to sell and support our products and services in certain jurisdictions.",Business Risk
"In addition, changes in telecommunications regulations could impact our service provider customers&#8217; purchase of our products and services, and they could also impact sales of our own regulated offerings.",Business Risk
"Additional areas of uncertainty that could impact sales of our products and services include laws, regulations, or customer procurement requirements related to encryption technology, data, artificial intelligence, privacy, cybersecurity, environmental sustainability (including climate change), human rights, product certification, product accessibility, country of origin, and national security controls applicable to our supply chain.",Security Risk
"Changes in regulatory requirements in any of these areas or our actual or perceived failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or other obligations relating to these areas could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.",Business Risk
"Risks Related to Ownership of Our Stock 

Our stock price may be volatile.",Market Risk
"Historically, our common stock has experienced substantial price volatility, particularly as a result of variations between our actual financial results and the published expectations of analysts and as a result of announcements by our competitors and us.",Market Risk
"Furthermore, speculation in the press or investment community about our strategic position, financial condition, results of operations, business, security of our products, or significant transactions can cause changes in our stock price.",Market Risk

We can provide no assurances that our security measures designed to protect our customers&#8217; and our customers&#8217; customers&#8217; data will be effective.,Security Risk
"Our services and underlying infrastructure may in the future be materially breached or compromised as a result of the following: 

&#8226; third-party attempts to fraudulently induce our employees, partners or customers to disclose sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information to gain access to our customers&#8217; data or IT systems, or our data or our IT systems; 

&#8226; efforts by individuals or groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, such as state-sponsored organizations or nation-states, to launch coordinated attacks, including ransomware, destructive malware and distributed denial-of-service attacks; 

&#8226; third-party attempts to abuse our marketing, advertising, messaging or social products and functionalities to impersonate persons or organizations and disseminate information that is false, misleading or malicious;

&#8226; vulnerabilities in the products or components across the broad ecosystem that our services operate in conjunction with and are dependent on; 

&#8226; vulnerabilities existing within new technologies and infrastructures, including those from acquired companies; 

&#8226; attacks on, or vulnerabilities in, the many different underlying networks and services that power the Internet that our products depend on, most of which are not under our control or the control of our vendors, partners or customers; and 

&#8226; employee or contractor errors or intentional acts that compromise our security systems.",Security Risk
"These risks are mitigated, to the extent possible, by our ability to maintain and improve business and data governance policies, enhanced processes and internal security controls, including our ability to escalate and respond to known and potential risks.",Security Risk
"Our Board of Directors, Cybersecurity and Privacy Committee and executive management are regularly briefed on our cybersecurity policies and practices and ongoing efforts to improve security, as well as updates on cybersecurity events.",Security Risk
We can provide no assurances that our implemented systems and processes designed to protect our customers&#8217; and our customers&#8217; customers&#8217; proprietary and other sensitive data will provide absolute security or otherwise be effective or that a material breach will not occur.,Security Risk
"For example, our ability to mitigate these risks may be impacted by the following: 

&#8226; frequent changes to, and growth in complexity of, the techniques used to breach, obtain unauthorized access to, or sabotage IT systems and infrastructure, which are generally not recognized until launched against a target, and could result in our being unable to anticipate or implement adequate measures to prevent such techniques; 

&#8226; the continued evolution of our internal IT systems as we early adopt new technologies and new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers, which increases the complexity of our IT systems; 

&#8226; the acquisition of new companies, requiring us to incorporate and secure different or more complex IT environments; 

&#8226; authorization by our customers to third-party technology providers to access their customer data, which may lead to our customers&#8217; inability to protect their data that is stored on our servers; and 

&#8226; our limited control over our customers or third-party technology providers, or the processing of data by third-party technology providers, which may not allow us to maintain the integrity or security of such transmissions or processing.",Security Risk
"In the normal course of business, we are and have been the target of malicious cyberattack attempts and have experienced other security incidents.",Security Risk
"Although, to date, such identified security events have not been material or significant to us, including to our reputation or business operations, or had a material financial impact, there can be no assurance that future cyberattacks will not be material or significant.",Security Risk
"Additionally, as our market presence grows, we may face increased risks of cyberattack attempts or security threats.",Security Risk
"A security breach or incident could result in unauthorized parties obtaining access to, or the denial of authorized access to, our IT systems or data, or our customers&#8217; systems or data, including intellectual property and proprietary, sensitive or other confidential information.",Security Risk
"A security breach could also result in a loss of confidence in the security of our services, damage our reputation, negatively impact our future sales, disrupt our business and lead to increases in insurance premiums and legal, regulatory and financial exposure and liability.",Security Risk
"Finally, the detection, prevention and remediation of known or potential security vulnerabilities, including those arising from third-party hardware or software, may result in additional financial burdens due to additional direct and indirect costs, such as additional infrastructure capacity spending to mitigate any system degradation and the reallocation of resources from development activities.",Security Risk
"For example, in April 2022, we learned a threat actor had obtained unauthorized access to several databases on Heroku, a Salesforce platform-as-a-service.",Security Risk
"The threat actor downloaded stored customer security credentials and passwords for logging into GitHub, a third-party code hosting service used by both Heroku and Heroku customers.",Security Risk
The threat actor also was able to download passwords for a subset of customer user accounts and access the encryption key.,Security Risk
"While we do not believe this incident materially affected our business or financial results, there is no assurance that such circumstances or other similar incidents in the future could not result in a material adverse effect on our business.",Business Risk
Defects or disruptions in our services could diminish demand for our services and subject us to substantial liability.,Business Risk
"Because our services are complex and incorporate a variety of hardware, proprietary software, third-party and open-source software, our services may have errors or defects that could result in unanticipated downtime for our subscribers and harm to our reputation and our business.",Business Risk
Our customers may also use our services in unanticipated ways that may cause a disruption in services for other customers attempting to access their data.,Technology Risk
Cloud services frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released.,Technology Risk
We may also encounter difficulties integrating acquired technologies into our services and in augmenting the technologies to meet the quality standards that are consistent with our brand and reputation.,Technology Risk
"As a result, our services may have errors or defects resulting from the complexities of integrating acquisitions.",Business Risk
"We have from time to time found defects in, and experienced disruptions to, our services and new defects or disruptions may occur in the future.",Business Risk
"Such defects could be the result of employee, contractor or other third-party acts or inaction, and could negatively affect our brand and reputation.",Business Risk
We have experienced and may in the future experience defects in our products that created vulnerabilities that inadvertently permitted access to protected customer data.,Security Risk
"For example, in December 2021, a vulnerability in a widely-used open-source software application, known as Apache Log4j, was identified that could have allowed bad actors to remotely access a target, potentially stealing data or taking control of a target&#8217;s system.",Security Risk
"While this issue did not materially affect our business, reputation or financial results, there is no assurance that such circumstances or other incidents could not occur in the future that have a material adverse effect on our business or subject us to substantial liability.",Business Risk
"Vulnerabilities in open source or any proprietary or third-party product can persist even after security patches have been issued if customers have not installed the most recent updates, or if the attackers exploited the vulnerabilities before patching was complete.",Security Risk
"In some cases, vulnerabilities may not be immediately detected, which may make it difficult to recover critical services and lead to damaged assets.",Security Risk
"Since our customers use our services for important aspects of their business, any errors, defects, disruptions in service or other performance problems could hurt our reputation and may damage our customers&#8217; businesses.",Business Risk
"As a result, customers could elect to not renew our services or delay or withhold payment to us.",Business Risk
"We could also lose future sales or customers may make warranty or other claims against us, which could result in an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts, an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation.",Business Risk
"Any interruptions or delays in services from third parties, including data center hosting facilities, cloud computing platform providers and other hardware and software vendors, or from our inability to adequately plan for and manage service interruptions or infrastructure capacity requirements, could impair the delivery of our services and harm our business.",Business Risk
We currently serve our customers from third-party data center hosting facilities and cloud computing platform providers located in the United States and other countries.,Technology Risk
"We also rely on computer hardware purchased or leased from, software licensed from, and cloud computing platforms provided by, third parties in order to offer our services, including database software, hardware and data from a variety of vendors.",General Risk
"Any disruption or damage to, or failure of our systems generally, including the systems of our third-party platform providers, could result in interruptions in our services and harm our business.",Business Risk
We have from time to time experienced interruptions in our services and such interruptions may occur in the future.,Business Risk
"The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted and continues to disrupt the supply chain of hardware needed to maintain these third-party systems or to run our business, which affects our and our suppliers&#8217; operations.",Security Risk
"In addition, supply chain disruptions due to geopolitical developments in Europe and indirect effects have further complicated existing supply chain constraints.",Market Risk
"As we increase our reliance on these third-party systems, particularly with respect to third-party cloud computing platforms, our exposure to damage from service interruptions may increase.",Technology Risk
"Interruptions in our services may cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, cause customers to make warranty or other claims against us or to terminate their subscriptions, and adversely affect 

our attrition rates and our ability to attract new customers, all of which would reduce our revenue.",Business Risk
Our business and reputation would also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our services are unreliable.,Business Risk
"For many of our offerings, our production environment and customers&#8217; data are replicated in near real time in a separate facility located elsewhere.",Technology Risk
"Certain offerings, including some offerings of companies added through acquisitions, may be served through alternate facilities or arrangements.",Financial Risk
"We do not control the operation of any of these facilities, and they may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events.",Business Risk
"They may also be subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of destruction or vandalism or similar misconduct, as well as local administrative actions (including shelter-in-place or similar orders), changes to legal or permitting requirements and litigation to stop, limit or delay operation.",Security Risk
"In addition, supply chain disruptions due to geopolitical developments in Europe may also lead to power disruptions in regions where our facilities are located.",Business Risk
"Despite precautions taken at these facilities, such as disaster recovery and business continuity arrangements, the occurrence of any of the foregoing events or risks, or a natural disaster or public health emergency, an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems or operational failures at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our services, and no assurance can be provided that any such interruptions would be remediated without significant cost or in a timely manner or at all.",Business Risk
"The hardware, software, data and cloud computing platforms that we rely on may not continue to be available at reasonable prices, on commercially reasonable terms or at all.",Technology Risk
"Any loss of the right to use any of these hardware, software, data or cloud computing platforms could significantly increase our expenses and disrupt or otherwise result in delays in the provisioning of our services until equivalent technology is either developed by us, or, if available, is identified, obtained through purchase or license and integrated into our services, and no assurance can be provided that such equivalent technology would be developed or obtained in a timely manner or at all.",Technology Risk
"If we do not accurately plan for our infrastructure capacity requirements and we experience significant strains on our data center capacity, our customers could experience performance degradation or service outages that may subject us to financial liabilities, result in customer losses and harm our reputation and business.",Business Risk
"As we add data centers and capacity and continue to move to cloud computing platform providers, we move or transfer our data and our customers&#8217; data from time to time.",Technology Risk
"Despite precautions taken during this process, any unsuccessful data transfers may impair the delivery of our services, which may damage our business.",Business Risk
"As we acquire and invest in companies or technologies, we may not realize the expected business or financial benefits and the acquisitions could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results and the market value of our common stock.",Business Risk
"As part of our business strategy, we periodically make investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies and intellectual property rights.",Technology Risk
We continue to evaluate such opportunities and expect to continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future.,Financial Risk
"Acquisitions and other transactions, arrangements and investments involve numerous risks and could create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures, including:

&#8226; currency and regulatory risks associated with foreign countries and potential additional cybersecurity and compliance risks resulting from entry into new markets; 

&#8226; difficulties and strain on resources in integrating acquired operations, technologies, services, platforms and personnel; 

&#8226; regulatory challenges from antitrust or other regulatory authorities that may block, delay or impose conditions (such as divestitures, ownership or operational restrictions or other structural or behavioral remedies) on the completion of transactions or the integration of acquired operations; 

&#8226; failure to fully assimilate, integrate or retrain acquired employees, which may lead to retention risk with respect to both key acquired employees and our existing key employees or disruption to existing teams; 

&#8226; differences between our values and those of our acquired companies, as well as disruptions to our workplace culture; 

&#8226; inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition or investment costs; 

&#8226; challenges with the acquired company&#8217;s customers and partners, including the inability to maintain such relationships and changes to perception of the acquired business as a result of the acquisition; 

&#8226; challenges with the acquired company&#8217;s third-party service providers, including those that are required for ongoing access to third-party data; 

&#8226; potential for acquired products to impact the profitability of existing products; 

&#8226; unanticipated expenses related to acquired technology and its integration into our existing technology; 

&#8226; known and potential unknown liabilities associated with the acquired businesses, including due to litigation; 

&#8226; difficulties in managing, or potential write-offs of, acquired assets or investments, and potential financial and credit risks associated with acquired customers; 

&#8226; negative impact to our results of operations because of the depreciation and amortization of acquired intangible assets , fixed assets and operating lease right-of-use assets; 

&#8226; the loss of acquired unearned revenue and unbilled unearned revenue; 

&#8226; challenges relating to the structure of an investment, such as governance, accountability and decision-making conflicts that may arise in the context of a joint venture or other majority ownership investments; 

&#8226; difficulties in and financial costs of addressing acquired compensation structures inconsistent with our compensation structure; 

&#8226; additional stock-based compensation issued or assumed in connection with the acquisition, including the impact on stockholder dilution and our results of operations; 

&#8226; delays in customer purchases due to uncertainty related to any acquisition; 

&#8226; ineffective or inadequate controls, procedures and policies at the acquired company; 

&#8226; in the case of foreign acquisitions, challenges caused by integrating operations over distance, and across different languages, cultures and political environments; and 

&#8226; the tax effects of any such acquisitions including related integration and business operation changes, and assessment of the impact on the realizability of our future tax assets or liabilities.",Security Risk
Any of these risks could harm our business or negatively impact our results of operations.,Business Risk
"In addition, to facilitate acquisitions or investments, we may seek additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all, which may affect our ability to complete subsequent acquisitions or investments, and which may affect the risks of owning our common stock.",Financial Risk
"For example, if we finance acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible or other debt securities or loans, our existing stockholders may be diluted, or we could face constraints related to the terms of, and repayment obligation related to, the incurrence of indebtedness that could affect the market price of our common stock.",Market Risk
"Our ability to acquire other businesses or technologies, make strategic investments or integrate acquired businesses effectively may be impaired by trade tensions and increased global scrutiny of foreign investments and acquisitions and investments in the technology sector.",Technology Risk
"For example, several countries, including the United States and countries in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, are considering or have adopted restrictions of varying kinds on transactions involving foreign investments and acquisitions.",Market Risk
Antitrust authorities in a number of countries have also reviewed acquisitions and investments in the technology industry with increased scrutiny.,Technology Risk
"Governments may continue to adopt or tighten restrictions of this nature, some of which may apply to acquisitions, investments or integrations of businesses by us, and such restrictions or government actions could negatively impact our business and financial results.",Business Risk
"Supporting our existing and growing customer base could strain our personnel resources and infrastructure, and if we are unable to scale our operations and increase productivity, we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan.",Business Risk
"We continue to experience significant growth in our customer base and personnel, including through acquisitions, which has placed a strain on and in the future may stress the capabilities of our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure.",Business Risk
"We anticipate that significant additional investments, including in human capital software, will be required to scale our operations and increase productivity, to address the needs of our customers, to further develop and enhance our 

services, to expand into new geographic areas, and to scale with our overall growth.",Technology Risk
"The additional investments we are making will increase our cost base, which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by reducing expenses in the short term.",Financial Risk
We may not be able to make these investments as quickly or effectively as necessary to successfully scale our operations.,Business Risk
We regularly upgrade or replace our various software systems and processes.,Technology Risk
"If the implementations of these new applications are delayed, or if we encounter unforeseen problems with our new systems and processes or in migrating away from our existing systems and processes, our operations and our ability to manage our business could be negatively impacted.",Business Risk
"For example, our efforts to further automate our processes for customer contracts may be complicated by unanticipated operating difficulties.",Business Risk
Our success will depend in part upon the ability of our senior management to manage our projected growth effectively.,Business Risk
"To do so, we must continue to increase the productivity of our existing employees and to hire, train and manage new employees as needed.",Market Risk
"Additionally, changes in our work environment and workforce in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic could adversely affect our operations.",Business Risk
"In particular, although most of our offices have reopened, we have offered a significant percentage of our employees the flexibility in the amount of time they work in an office.",Technology Risk
"Our new office model and any adjustments made to our current and future office environments or work-from-home policies, including changes from the restructuring plan announced in January 2023, may not meet the needs and expectations of our workforce, which could negatively impact our ability to increase productivity of our existing workforce and to attract and retain our employees.",Business Risk
"To manage the expected domestic and international growth of our operations and personnel, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, our reporting systems and procedures, and our utilization of real estate.",Financial Risk
"If we fail to successfully scale our operations and increase productivity, we may be unable to execute our business plan and the value of our common stock could decline.",Business Risk
"If our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our services or if they reduce the number of paying subscriptions at the time of renewal, our revenue and current remaining performance obligation could decline and our business may suffer.",Business Risk
"If we cannot accurately predict subscription renewals or upgrade rates, we may not meet our revenue targets, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.",Market Risk
"Our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our services after the expiration of their contractual subscription period, which is typically 12 to 36 months, and in the normal course of business, some customers have elected not to renew.",Market Risk
"In addition, our customers may renew for fewer subscriptions, renew for shorter contract lengths, or switch to lower cost offerings of our services.",Market Risk
It is difficult to predict attrition rates given our varied customer base and the number of multi-year subscription contracts.,Market Risk
"Historically, our subscription and support revenues primarily consisted of subscription fees; however, with the acquisitions of MuleSoft and Tableau, subscription and support revenues also now include term software license sales.",Security Risk
We have less experience forecasting the renewal rates of such term software license sales.,Market Risk
"Our attrition rates may increase or fluctuate as a result of various factors, including customer dissatisfaction with our services, customers&#8217; spending levels, mix of customer base, decreases in the number of users at our customers, competition, pricing increases or changes and deteriorating general economic conditions.",Business Risk
"Our future success also depends in part on our ability to sell additional features and services, more subscriptions or enhanced editions of our services to our current customers.",Market Risk
This may also require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts that are targeted at senior management.,Market Risk
"Similarly, the rate at which our customers purchase new or enhanced services depends on a number of factors, including general economic conditions and customer receptiveness to any price changes related to these additional features and services.",General Risk
"If customers do not renew their subscriptions, do not purchase additional features or enhanced subscriptions or if attrition rates increase, we may not meet our revenue targets and our business could be harmed, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.",Business Risk
Periodic changes to our sales organization can be disruptive and may reduce our rate of growth.,Business Risk
"We periodically change and make adjustments to our sales organization in response to market opportunities, competitive threats, management changes, product introductions or enhancements, acquisitions, sales performance, increases in sales headcount, cost levels and other internal and external considerations.",Market Risk
"Such sales organization changes have in some periods resulted in, and may in the future result in, a reduction of productivity, which could negatively impact our rate of growth in the current and future quarters and operating results, including revenue.",Business Risk
"For example, the restructuring plan we announced in January 2023 involved such changes to our sales organization, which could negatively impact our productivity, growth rate and operating results, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.",Market Risk
"In addition, any significant change to the way we structure our compensation of our sales organization may be disruptive and may affect our revenue growth.",Business Risk
Our ability to deliver our services is dependent on the development and maintenance of the infrastructure of the Internet by third parties.,Technology Risk
The Internet&#8217;s infrastructure comprises many different networks and services that are highly fragmented and distributed by design.,Technology Risk
"This infrastructure is run by a series of independent third-party organizations that work together to provide the infrastructure and supporting services of the Internet under the governance of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Numbers and Names (&#8220;ICANN&#8221;) and the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority, now under the stewardship of ICANN.",General Risk
"The Internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damages to portions of its infrastructure, denial-of-service attacks or related cyber incidents, and it could face outages and delays in the future, potentially reducing the availability of the Internet to us or our customers for delivery of our Internet-based services.",Technology Risk
Any resulting interruptions in our services or the ability of our customers to access our services could result in a loss of potential or existing customers and harm our business.,Business Risk
"In addition, certain countries have implemented, or may implement, legislative and technological actions that either do or can effectively regulate access to the Internet, including the ability of Internet service providers to limit access to specific websites or content.",Technology Risk
"Other countries have attempted, are attempting or may attempt to change or limit the legal protections available to businesses that depend on the Internet for the delivery of their services.",Legal Risk
"These actions could potentially limit or interrupt access to our services from certain countries or Internet service providers, increase our risk or add liabilities, impede our growth, productivity and operational effectiveness, result in the loss of potential or existing customers and harm our business.",Business Risk
Sales to customers outside the United States expose us to risks inherent in international operations.,Business Risk
We sell our services throughout the world and are subject to risks and challenges associated with international business.,Business Risk
We intend to seek to continue to expand our international sales efforts.,Market Risk
"The risks and challenges associated with sales to customers outside the United States or those that can affect international operations generally, include: 

&#8226; regional economic and political conditions, natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism and actual or threatened public health emergencies, including the COVID-19 pandemic; 

&#8226; localization of our services, including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses; 

&#8226; regulatory frameworks or business practices favoring local competitors; 

&#8226; pressure on the creditworthiness of sovereign nations, where we have customers and a balance of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities; 

&#8226; foreign currency fluctuations and controls, which may make our services more expensive for international customers and could add volatility to our operating results; 

&#8226; compliance with multiple, conflicting, ambiguous or evolving governmental laws and regulations, including employment, tax, privacy, anti-corruption, import/export, customs, anti-boycott, sanctions and embargoes, antitrust, data transfer, storage and protection and industry-specific laws and regulations, including rules related to compliance by our third-party resellers and our ability to identify and respond timely to compliance issues when they occur; 

&#8226; liquidity issues or political actions by sovereign nations, including nations with a controlled currency environment, which could result in decreased values of these balances or potential difficulties protecting our foreign assets or satisfying local obligations; 

&#8226; vetting and monitoring our third-party resellers in new and evolving markets to confirm they maintain standards consistent with our brand and reputation; 

&#8226; treatment of revenue from international sources, evolving domestic and international tax environments, and changes to tax codes, including being subject to foreign tax laws and being liable for paying withholding taxes in foreign jurisdictions; 

&#8226; impacts of or uncertainties regarding the United Kingdom&#8217;s exit from the EU (&#8220;Brexit&#8221;) on regulations, currencies, taxes and operations, including possible disruptions to the sale of our services or the movement of our people between the United Kingdom, EU and other locations; 

&#8226; uncertainty regarding the imposition of and changes in the United States&#8217; and other governments&#8217; trade regulations, trade wars, tariffs, other restrictions or other geopolitical events, including the evolving relations between the United States and China, the United States and Russia and conflict in Europe; 

&#8226; changes in the public perception of governments in the regions where we operate or plan to operate; 

&#8226; regional data privacy laws and other regulatory requirements that apply to outsourced service providers and to the transmission of our customers&#8217; data across international borders, which grow more complex as we scale, expand into new markets and enhance the breadth of our service offerings; 

&#8226; different pricing environments; 

&#8226; difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; 

&#8226; different or lesser protection of our intellectual property, including increased risk of theft of our proprietary technology and other intellectual property, and more prevalent cybersecurity risks, particularly in jurisdictions in which we have historically chosen not to operate; and 

&#8226; longer accounts receivable payment cycles and other collection difficulties.",Business Risk
Any of these factors could negatively impact our business and results of operations.,Business Risk
"The above factors may also negatively impact our ability to successfully expand into emerging market countries, where we have little or no operating experience, where it can be costly and challenging to establish and maintain operations, including hiring and managing required personnel, and difficult to promote our brand, and where we may not benefit from any first-to-market advantage or otherwise succeed.",Business Risk
"As more of our sales efforts are targeted at larger enterprise customers, our sales cycle may become more time-consuming and expensive, we may encounter pricing pressure and implementation and configuration challenges, and we may have to delay revenue recognition for some complex transactions, all of which could harm our business and operating results.",Business Risk
"As we target more of our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers, including governmental entities, and specific industries, such as financial services and healthcare and life sciences, we may face greater costs, longer sales cycles, greater competition and less predictability in completing some of our sales.",Market Risk
"In these market segments, the customer&#8217;s decision to use our services is often an enterprise-wide decision and, if so, may require us to provide greater levels of education regarding the use and benefits of our services, as well as addressing concerns regarding privacy and data protection laws and regulations of prospective customers with international operations or whose own customers operate internationally.",Market Risk
"In addition, larger customers and governmental entities often demand more configuration, integration services and features.",Market Risk
"As a result of these factors, these sales opportunities often require us to devote greater sales support and professional services resources to individual customers, driving up costs and time required to complete sales and diverting our own sales and professional services resources to a smaller number of larger transactions, while potentially requiring us to delay revenue recognition on some of these transactions until the technical or implementation requirements have been met.",Business Risk
Pricing and packaging strategies for enterprise and other customers for subscriptions to our existing and future service offerings may not be widely accepted by other new or existing customers.,Market Risk
Our adoption of such new pricing and packaging strategies may harm our business.,Business Risk
"For large enterprise customers, professional services are often performed by us, a third party, or a combination of our own staff and a third party.",Security Risk
Our strategy is to work with third parties to increase the breadth of capability and depth of capacity for delivery of these services to our customers.,General Risk
"If a customer is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us or a third party or with the type of services or solutions delivered, we could incur additional costs to address the situation, the profitability of that work might be impaired, and the customer&#8217;s dissatisfaction with our services could damage our ability to obtain additional work from that customer.",Business Risk
"In addition, negative publicity related to our customer relationships, regardless of its accuracy, may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new business with current or prospective customers.",Business Risk
"We may lose key members of our management team or development and operations personnel, and may be unable to attract and retain employees we need to support our operations and growth.",Business Risk
"Our success depends substantially upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key members of management, particularly our chief executive officer.",Business Risk
"From time to time, there may be changes in our management team resulting from the hiring, departure or realignment of executives.",General Risk
"For example, in January 2023, Bret Taylor, our former co-CEO and Vice Chair of our board of directors, resigned from these positions with our company.",Business Risk
Such changes may be disruptive to our business.,Business Risk
We are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing development and operations personnel because of the complexity of our services and technologies.,Technology Risk
"Our executive officers, key management, development or operations personnel could terminate their employment with us at any time.",Business Risk
Effective succession planning for management is important to our long-term success.,Business Risk
"If we do not develop adequate succession planning for our key personnel, the loss of one or more of our key employees or groups of employees could seriously harm our business.",Business Risk
"The technology industry is subject to substantial and continuous competition for engineers with high levels of experience in designing, developing and managing software and Internet-related services, as well as competition for sales executives, data scientists and operations personnel.",Market Risk
"We have experienced, and currently experience, challenges with significant competition in talent recruitment and retention, and may not in the future be successful in recruiting or retaining talent or achieving the workforce diversity goals we have set publicly.",Market Risk
"We have from time to time experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring, developing, integrating and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications.",Business Risk
"These difficulties may be amplified by evolving restrictions on immigration, travel, or availability of visas for skilled 

technology workers.",Technology Risk
"If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed.",Business Risk
"In January 2023, we announced a restructuring plan (the &#8220;Restructuring Plan&#8221;) intended to reduce operating costs, improve operating margins and continue advancing our ongoing commitment to profitable growth.",General Risk
The Restructuring Plan includes a reduction of our workforce and select real estate exits and office space reductions within certain markets.,Business Risk
"The actions associated with the employee restructuring under the Restructuring Plan are expected to be substantially complete by the end of fiscal 2024, subject to local law and consultation requirements.",Legal Risk
"This Restructuring Plan, or any similar actions taken in the future, could negatively impact our ability to attract, integrate, retain and motivate key employees.",Business Risk
"In addition, we believe in the importance of our corporate culture, which fosters dialogue, collaboration, recognition, equality and a sense of family.",Market Risk
"As our organization has grown and expanded globally, and as our workplace plans have developed, including, for example, the Restructuring Plan, we have in the past and may in the future find it increasingly difficult to maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture globally, including managing the complexities of communicating with all employees.",Business Risk
"Our inability to maintain our corporate culture could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain employees, harm our reputation with customers, or negatively impact our future growth.",Business Risk
Any failure in our delivery of high-quality professional and technical support services may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our financial results.,Business Risk
Our customers depend on our support organization to resolve technical issues relating to our applications.,Technology Risk
We may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in customer demand for support services across our varying and diverse offerings.,Market Risk
"Outsourced provision of technical support may be suddenly and adversely impacted by unforeseen events, for example, as occurred when certain business process outsourced service providers were delayed in effectively servicing our customers due to conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic.",Business Risk
"Increased customer demand for these services, without corresponding revenues, could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results.",Business Risk
"In addition, our sales process is highly dependent on our applications and business reputation and on positive recommendations from our existing customers.",Market Risk
"Any failure to maintain high-quality technical support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality support, could adversely affect our reputation, our ability to sell our service offerings to existing and prospective customers, and our business, operating results and financial position.",Business Risk
"Strategic and Industry Risks 

The markets in which we participate are intensely competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed.",Market Risk
"The market for enterprise applications and platform services is highly competitive, rapidly evolving, fragmented and subject to changing technology, low barriers to entry, shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services.",Technology Risk
Many prospective customers have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to implement and integrate their current enterprise software into their businesses and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate away from their current solution to an enterprise cloud computing application service.,Technology Risk
"Additionally, third-party developers may be reluctant to build application services on our platform since they have invested in other competing technology platforms.",Technology Risk
"Our current competitors include: 

&#8226; internally developed enterprise applications by our potential customers&#8217; IT departments; 

&#8226; vendors of packaged business software, as well as companies offering enterprise apps delivered through on-premises offerings from enterprise software application vendors and cloud computing application service providers, either individually or with others; 

&#8226; software companies that provide their product or service free of charge as a single product or when bundled with other offerings, or only charge a premium for advanced features and functionality, as well as companies that offer solutions that are sold without a direct sales organization; 

&#8226; vendors who offer software tailored to specific services as opposed to our full suite of service offerings, including suppliers of traditional business intelligence and data preparation products, integration software vendors, marketing vendors or e-commerce solutions vendors; 

&#8226; productivity tool and email providers, unified communications providers and consumer application companies that have entered the business software market; 

&#8226; traditional platform development environment companies and cloud computing development platform companies who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new apps that run on the customers&#8217; current infrastructure or as hosted services.",Market Risk
"In addition, we may face more competition as we expand our product offerings.",Market Risk
"Some of our current and potential competitors may have competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories, more significant 

installed bases, broader geographic scope, broader suites of service offerings and larger marketing budgets, as well as substantially greater financial, technical, personnel and other resources.",Market Risk
"In addition, many of our current and potential competitors have established marketing relationships and access to larger customer bases, and have major distribution agreements with consultants, system integrators and resellers.",Market Risk
"We also experience competition from smaller, younger competitors that may be more agile in responding to customers&#8217; demands and offer more targeted and simplified solutions.",Market Risk
"These competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements, or provide competitive pricing, more flexible contracts or faster implementations.",Market Risk
"As a result, even if our services are more effective than the products and services that our competitors offer, potential customers might select competitive products and services in lieu of purchasing our services.",Market Risk
"For all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors, which could negatively impact our future sales and harm our business.",Business Risk
Our efforts to expand our service offerings and to develop and integrate our existing services in order to keep pace with technological developments may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate and harm our business.,Technology Risk
"We derive a significant portion of our revenue from subscriptions to our CRM enterprise cloud computing application services, and we expect this will continue for the foreseeable future.",Technology Risk
Our efforts to expand our current service offerings may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate.,Business Risk
"In addition, the markets for certain of our offerings remain relatively new and it is uncertain whether our efforts, and related investments, will ever result in significant revenue for us.",Market Risk
"Further, the introduction of significant platform changes and upgrades may not result in long term revenue growth.",Technology Risk
"In July 2021, we completed our acquisition of Slack, our largest acquisition to date.",Technology Risk
"Slack is a relatively new category of business technology in a rapidly evolving market for software, programs and tools used by knowledge workers.",Market Risk
"We may not succeed in enhancing and improving the features, integrations and capabilities of Slack, or effectively introduce compelling new features, integrations and capabilities that reflect or anticipate the changing nature of the market which may result in an inability to attract new users and organizations and increase revenue from existing paid customers.",Market Risk
"If we are unable to develop enhancements to, and new features for, our existing or new services that keep pace with rapid technological developments, our business could be harmed.",Technology Risk
"For example, we may be required to continuously enhance our AI offerings to improve the quality of recommendations provided to our customers.",Technology Risk
"The success of enhancements, new features and services depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction and market acceptance of the feature, service or enhancement by customers, administrators and developers, as well as our ability to integrate all of our product and service offerings and develop adequate selling capabilities in new markets.",Market Risk
Failure in this regard may significantly impair our revenue growth as well as negatively impact our operating results if the additional costs are not offset by additional revenues.,Business Risk
"In addition, because our services are designed to operate over various network technologies and on a variety of mobile devices, operating systems and computer hardware and software platforms using a standard browser, we will need to continuously modify and enhance our services to keep pace with changes in Internet-related hardware, software, communication, browser, app development platform and database technologies, as well as continue to maintain and support our services on legacy systems.",Technology Risk
We may not be successful in either developing these modifications and enhancements or in bringing them to market timely.,Technology Risk
"Additionally, if we fail to anticipate or identify significant Internet-related and other technology trends and developments early enough, or if we do not devote appropriate resources to adapting to such trends and developments, our business could be harmed.",Technology Risk
"Uncertainties about the timing and nature of new network platforms or technologies, modifications to existing platforms or technologies, including text messaging capabilities, or changes in customer usage patterns thereof could increase our research and development or service delivery expenses or lead to our increased reliance on certain vendors.",Technology Risk
"Any failure of our services to operate effectively with future network platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our services, result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our business.",Business Risk
Our continued success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brands.,Market Risk
"We believe that the brand identities we have developed, including associations with trust, customer success, innovation, performance and equality and sustainability have significantly contributed to the success of our business.",Market Risk
"Maintaining and enhancing the Salesforce brand and our other brands is critical to expanding our base of customers, partners and employees.",Security Risk
"Our brand strength, particularly for our core services, depends largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and to continue to provide high-quality innovative products, services and features in a secure, reliable manner that enhances our customers&#8217; success even as we scale and expand our services.",Technology Risk
"In order to maintain and enhance the strength of our brands, we have made and may in the future make substantial investments to expand or improve our product offerings and services, or we may enter new markets that may be accompanied by initial complications or ultimately prove to be unsuccessful.",Business Risk
"In addition, we have secured the naming rights to facilities controlled by third parties, such as office towers and a transit center, and any negative events or publicity arising in connection with these facilities could adversely impact our brand.",Business Risk
"Further, entry into markets with weaker protection of brands or changes in the legal systems in countries we operate may impact our ability to protect our brands.",Legal Risk
"If we fail to maintain, enhance or protect our brands, or if we incur excessive expenses in our efforts to do so, our business, operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.",Business Risk
"We are subject to risks associated with our strategic investments, including partial or complete loss of invested capital.",Financial Risk
"Significant changes in the fair value of this portfolio, including changes in the valuation of our investments in publicly traded and privately held companies, could negatively impact our financial results.",Financial Risk
"We manage a portfolio of strategic investments in both privately held and publicly traded companies focused primarily on enterprise cloud companies, technology startups and system integrators.",Technology Risk
"Our investments range from early to late stage companies, including investments made concurrent with a company&#8217;s initial public offering.",Market Risk
"We invest in companies that we believe are digitally transforming their industries, improving customer experiences, helping us expand our solution ecosystem or supporting other corporate initiatives.",Technology Risk
We continually evaluate our investments in privately held and publicly traded companies.,Market Risk
"In certain cases, our ability to sell these investments may be impacted by contractual obligations to hold the securities for a set period of time after a public offering.",Financial Risk
"In addition, the financial success of our investment in any company is typically dependent on a liquidity event, such as a public offering, acquisition or other favorable market event reflecting appreciation to the cost of our initial investment.",Financial Risk
All of our investments are therefore subject to a risk of partial or total loss of invested capital.,Financial Risk
"We anticipate additional volatility to our consolidated statements of operations due to changes in market prices, observable price changes and both temporary and permanent impairments to our investments.",Market Risk
These changes could be material based on market conditions and events.,Market Risk
"While historically our strategic investment portfolio has had a positive impact on our financial results, we have had periods where our investment portfolio has recorded net losses and may have losses again in future periods, particularly in periods of significant market fluctuations that affect our equity securities within our strategic investments portfolio.",Market Risk
"Volatility in global market conditions, including recent economic disruptions, inflation and ongoing volatility in the public equity markets, may impact our strategic investment portfolio and our financial results may fluctuate from historical results and expectations.",Market Risk
"If third-party developers and providers do not continue to embrace our technology delivery model and enterprise cloud computing services, or if our customers seek warranties from us for third-party applications, integrations, data and content, our business could be harmed.",Business Risk
"Our success depends on the willingness of a growing community of third-party developers and technology providers to build applications and provide integrations, data and content that are complementary to our services.",Technology Risk
"Without the continued development of these applications and provision of such integrations, data and content, both current and potential customers may not find our services sufficiently attractive, which could impact future sales.",Technology Risk
"In addition, for those customers who authorize a third-party technology partner to access their data, we do not provide any warranty related to the functionality, security or integrity of the data access, transmission or processing.",Technology Risk
"Despite contract provisions to protect us, customers may look to us to support and provide warranties for the third-party applications, integrations, data and content, even though not developed or sold by us, which may expose us to potential claims, liabilities and obligations, all of which could harm our reputation and our business.",Business Risk
"Social and ethical issues, including the use or capabilities of AI in our offerings, may result in reputational harm and liability.",Technology Risk
"Policies we adopt or choose not to adopt on social and ethical issues, especially regarding the use of our products, may be unpopular with some of our employees or with our customers or potential customers, which has in the past impacted and may in the future impact our ability to attract or retain employees and customers.",Business Risk
We also may choose not to conduct business with potential customers or discontinue or not expand business with existing customers due to these policies.,Business Risk
"Further, actions taken by our customers and employees, including through the use or misuse of our products or new technologies for illegal activities or improper information sharing, may result in reputational harm or possible liability.",Business Risk
"For example, we have been subject to allegations in legal proceedings that we should be liable for the use of certain of our products by third parties.",Legal Risk
"Although we believe that such claims lack merit, legal proceedings can be lengthy, expensive and disruptive to our operations and the outcome of any claims or litigation, regardless of the merits, is inherently uncertain.",Legal Risk
"Regardless of outcome, these types of claims could cause reputational harm to our brand or result in liability.",Legal Risk
We are increasingly building AI into many of our offerings.,Technology Risk
"As with many innovations, AI and our Customer 360 platform present additional risks and challenges that could affect their adoption and therefore our business.",Technology Risk
"For example, the development of AI and Customer 360, the latter of which provides information regarding our customers&#8217; customers, presents emerging ethical issues.",Technology Risk
"If we enable or offer solutions that draw controversy due to their perceived or actual impact on human rights, privacy, employment, or in other social contexts, we may experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm or legal liability.",Legal Risk
Data practices by us or others that result in controversy could also impair the acceptance of AI solutions.,Technology Risk
"This in turn could undermine the decisions, predictions or analysis AI applications produce, subjecting us to competitive harm, legal 

liability and brand or reputational harm.",Legal Risk
"The rapid evolution of AI will require the application of resources to develop, test and maintain our products and services to help ensure that AI is implemented ethically in order to minimize unintended, harmful impact.",Technology Risk
"Uncertainty around new and emerging AI applications such as generative AI content creation may require additional investment in the development of proprietary datasets, machine learning models and systems to test for accuracy, bias and other variables, which are often complex, may be costly and could impact our profit margin if we decide to expand generative AI into our product offerings.",Technology Risk
"Developing, testing and deploying AI systems may also increase the cost profile of our offerings due to the nature of the computing costs involved in such systems.",Technology Risk
"Our aspirations and disclosures related to environmental, social and governance (&#8220;ESG&#8221;) matters expose us to risks that could adversely affect our reputation and performance.",Business Risk

&#8226; the availability of suppliers that can meet our sustainability, diversity and other ESG standards; 

&#8226; our ability to recruit, develop and retain diverse talent in our labor markets; and 

&#8226; the success of our organic growth and acquisitions or dispositions of businesses or operations.",Business Risk
Standards for tracking and reporting ESG matters continue to evolve.,Market Risk
"Our selection of voluntary disclosure frameworks and standards, and the interpretation or application of those frameworks and standards, may change from time to time or differ from those of others.",Security Risk
This may result in a lack of consistent or meaningful comparative data from period to period or between Salesforce and other companies in the same industry.,Market Risk
"In addition, our processes and controls may not comply with evolving standards for identifying, measuring and reporting ESG metrics, including ESG-related disclosures that may be required of public companies by the SEC, and such standards may change over time, which could result in significant revisions to our current goals, reported progress in achieving such goals, or ability to achieve such goals in the future.",Market Risk
"If our ESG practices do not meet evolving investor or other stakeholder expectations and standards, then our reputation, our ability to attract or retain employees, and our attractiveness as an investment, business partner, acquiror or service provider could be negatively impacted.",Business Risk

"Legal and Regulatory Risks 

Privacy concerns and laws as well as evolving regulation of cloud computing, cross-border data transfer restrictions and other domestic or foreign regulations may limit the use and adoption of our services and adversely affect our business.",Legal Risk
"Regulation related to the provision of services over the Internet is evolving, as federal, state and foreign governments continue to adopt new, or modify existing, laws and regulations addressing data privacy, cybersecurity, data protection, data sovereignty and the collection, processing, storage, hosting, transfer and use of data, generally.",Security Risk
"In some cases, data privacy laws and regulations, such as the European Union&#8217;s (&#8220;EU&#8221;) General Data Protection Regulation (&#8220;GDPR&#8221;), impose obligations directly on Salesforce as both a data controller and a data processor, as well as on many of our customers.",Legal Risk
"In addition, new domestic data privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (&#8220;CCPA&#8221;) as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (&#8220;CPRA&#8221;), the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, the Colorado Privacy Act, which goes into effect on July 1, 2023, the Connecticut Data Privacy Act, which goes into effect July 1, 2023, and the Utah Consumer Privacy Act, which goes into effect on December 31, 2023, similarly impose new obligations on us and many of our customers, potentially as both businesses and service providers.",Legal Risk
"These laws continue to evolve, and as various states introduce similar proposals, we and our customers could be exposed to additional regulatory burdens.",Legal Risk
"Further, laws and legislative proposals such as the EU&#8217;s proposed e-Privacy Regulation are increasingly aimed at the use of personal information for marketing purposes, and the tracking of individuals&#8217; online activities.",Legal Risk
"The EU has been developing new requirements related to the use of data, including in the Digital Services Act, that may impose additional rules and restrictions on the use of the data in our products and services.",Legal Risk
"In addition, various safe harbors have historically been provided to those who hosted content provided by others, such as safe harbors from monetary damages for copyright infringement arising from copyrighted content provided by customers and others and for defamation and other torts arising from information provided by customers and others.",Legal Risk
"There is an increasing 

demand for repealing or limiting these safe harbors by either judicial decision or legislation, and we have active legal proceedings that have been impacted by the repeal or limiting of safe harbors that were previously available to us.",Legal Risk
Loss of these safe harbors may require altering or limiting some of our services or may require additional contractual terms to avoid liabilities for our customers&#8217; misconduct.,Legal Risk
"Although we monitor the regulatory, judicial and legislative environment and have invested in addressing these developments, these laws may require us to make additional changes to our practices and services to enable us or our customers to meet the new legal requirements, and may also increase our potential liability exposure through new or higher potential penalties for noncompliance, including as a result of penalties, fines and lawsuits related to data breaches.",Legal Risk
"Furthermore, privacy laws and regulations are subject to differing interpretations and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions.",Legal Risk
"These and other requirements are causing increased scrutiny among customers, particularly in the public sector and highly regulated industries, and may be perceived differently from customer to customer.",Financial Risk
"These developments could reduce demand for our services, require us to take on more onerous obligations in our contracts, restrict our ability to store, transfer and process data or, in some cases, impact our ability or our customers' ability to offer our services in certain locations, to deploy our solutions, to reach current and prospective customers, or to derive insights from customer data globally.",Market Risk
"For example, on July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union (&#8220;CJEU&#8221;) invalidated the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework, one of the mechanisms that allowed companies, including Salesforce, to transfer personal data from the European Economic Area (&#8220;EEA&#8221;) to the United States.",Legal Risk
"Even if the CJEU decision upheld the Standard Contractual Clauses (&#8220;SCCs&#8221;) as an adequate transfer mechanism, the data exporters are now also required when relying on SCCs to conduct a transfer risk assessment to verify if anything in the law and/or practices of the destination country may impinge on the effectiveness of the SCCs in the context of the transfer at stake and, if so, to identify and adopt supplementary measures that are necessary to bring the level of protection of the data transferred to the EU standard of essential equivalence.",Legal Risk
"Where no supplementary measure is suitable, the data exporter should avoid, suspend or terminate the transfer.",Security Risk
"Depending on how the CJEU&#8217;s decision is enforced, the cost and complexity of providing our services in certain markets may increase.",Legal Risk
"While the EU and U.S. governments have recently advanced the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework to foster EU-to-U.S. data transfers and address the concerns raised in the aforementioned CJEU decision, it is uncertain whether this framework will be overturned in court like the previous two EU-U.S. bilateral cross-border transfer frameworks.",Legal Risk
"As a result, regulators may be inclined to continue to interpret the CJEU&#8217;s decision, and the logic behind it, as significantly restricting certain cross-border transfers.",Legal Risk
"Certain countries outside of the EEA (e.g., China and India) have also passed or are considering passing laws requiring varying degrees of local data residency.",Legal Risk
"By way of further example, statutory damages available through a private right of action for certain data breaches under the CPRA and potentially other states&#8217; laws, may increase our and our customers&#8217; potential liability and the demands our customers place on us.",Legal Risk
"The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, privacy laws, regulations and standards may limit the use and adoption of our services, reduce overall demand for our services, make it more difficult to meet expectations from our commitments to customers and our customers&#8217; customers, lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for noncompliance, impact our reputation, or slow the pace at which we close sales transactions, in particular where customers request specific warranties and unlimited indemnity for noncompliance with privacy laws, any of which could harm our business.",Legal Risk
"In September 2021, Salesforce announced the Hyperforce EU Operating Zone, which is expected to enable storage and processing of customer data solely within the EU.",Technology Risk
"This EU service may enhance our ability to attract and retain customers operating in the EU, but may also increase the cost and complexity of supporting those customers, and our customers may request similar offerings in other territories.",Market Risk
"In addition to government activity, privacy advocates and other industry groups have established or may establish new self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on our ability to provide our services globally.",Legal Risk
"Our customers expect us to meet voluntary certification and other standards established by third parties, such as TRUSTe.",Security Risk
"If we are unable to maintain these certifications or meet these standards, it could adversely affect our ability to provide our solutions to certain customers and could harm our business.",Business Risk
"In addition, we have seen a trend toward the private enforcement of data protection obligations, including through private actions for alleged noncompliance, which could harm our business and negatively impact our reputation.",Legal Risk
"For example, in 2020 we were made a party to a legal proceeding brought by a Dutch privacy advocacy group (the Privacy Collective) on behalf of certain Dutch citizens that claims we violated the GDPR and Dutch Telecommunications Act through the processing and sharing of data in connection with our Audience Studio and Data Studio products.",Legal Risk
"In December 2021, the Amsterdam District Court declared the Privacy Collective inadmissible in its claims against us and dismissed the case, however this is currently being appealed by the Privacy Collective.",Legal Risk
"We were also named as a defendant in a similar lawsuit brought in the UK, which has subsequently been dismissed.",Legal Risk
"Although we believe that these claims lack merit, these or similar future claims could cause reputational harm to our brand or result in liability.",Legal Risk
"In addition, the economic slowdown could increase the regulatory enforcement of privacy regulations, which could require our cooperation and or increase the cost of our compliance with the imposed regulations.",Legal Risk
"Furthermore, the uncertain and shifting regulatory environment and trust climate may raise concerns regarding data privacy and cybersecurity, which may cause our customers or our customers&#8217; customers to resist providing the data necessary to allow our customers to use our services effectively.",Security Risk
"In addition, new products we develop or acquire in connection with 

changing events may expose us to liability or regulatory risk.",Business Risk
Even the perception that the privacy and security of personal information are not satisfactorily protected or do not meet regulatory requirements could inhibit sales of our products or services and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions.,Security Risk

Regulators in certain industries have adopted and may in the future adopt regulations or interpretive positions regarding the use of cloud computing and other outsourced services.,Technology Risk
"The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, industry-specific laws, regulations and interpretive positions may limit our customers&#8217; use and adoption of our services and reduce overall demand for our services.",Legal Risk
"Compliance with these regulations may also require us to devote greater resources to support certain customers, which may increase costs and lengthen sales cycles.",Business Risk
"For example, some financial services regulators have imposed guidelines for use of cloud computing services that mandate specific controls or require financial services enterprises to obtain regulatory approval prior to outsourcing certain functions.",Technology Risk
"In the United States, a cybersecurity Executive Order released in May 2021 may heighten future compliance and incident reporting standards in order to obtain certain public sector contracts.",Security Risk
"If we are unable to comply with these guidelines or controls, or if our customers are unable to obtain regulatory approval to use our services where required, our business may be harmed.",Business Risk
"In addition, an inability to satisfy the standards of certain voluntary third-party certification bodies that our customers may expect, such as an attestation of compliance with the Payment Card Industry (&#8220;PCI&#8221;) Data Security Standards, may have an adverse impact on our business and results.",Security Risk
"If in the future we are unable to achieve or maintain industry-specific certifications or other requirements or standards relevant to our customers, it may harm our business and adversely affect our results.",Business Risk
"Further, in some cases, industry-specific, regionally-specific or product-specific laws, regulations or interpretive positions may impact our ability, as well as the ability of our customers, partners and data providers, to collect, augment, analyze, use, transfer and share personal and other information that is integral to certain services we provide.",Legal Risk
"The interpretation of many of these statutes, regulations and rulings is evolving in the courts and administrative agencies and an inability to comply may have an adverse impact on our business and results.",Legal Risk
"This impact may be particularly acute in countries that have passed or are considering passing legislation that requires data to remain localized &#8220;in country,&#8221; as this may impose financial costs on companies required to store data in jurisdictions not of their choosing and to use nonstandard operational processes that add complexity and are difficult and costly to integrate with global processes.",Legal Risk
"This is also true with respect to the global proliferation of laws regulating the financial services industry, including its use of cloud services.",Financial Risk
"In Europe, the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA), which aims to ensure the resilience of the EU financial sectors, including through mandatory risk management, incident reporting, resilience testing and third-party outsourcing restrictions, was formally adopted by the Council of the EU in November 2022.",Financial Risk
The UK is advancing similar legislation and other countries may follow.,Legal Risk
"Further, countries are considering legal frameworks on AI, which is a trend that may increase now that the European Commission has proposed the first such framework.",Technology Risk
Any failure or perceived failure by Salesforce to comply with such requirements could have an adverse impact on our business.,Business Risk
"There are various statutes, regulations and rulings relevant to direct email marketing and text-messaging industries, including the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (&#8220;TCPA&#8221;) and related Federal Communication Commission orders, which impose significant restrictions on the ability to utilize telephone calls and text messages to mobile telephone numbers as a means of communication, when the prior consent of the person being contacted has not been obtained.",Legal Risk
"We have been, and may in the future be, subject to one or more class-action lawsuits, as well as individual lawsuits, containing allegations that one of our businesses or customers violated the TCPA.",Legal Risk
"A determination that we or our customers violated the TCPA or other communications-based statutes could expose us to significant damage awards that could, individually or in the aggregate, materially harm our business.",Legal Risk

"Our technologies may be subject to injunction if they are found to infringe the rights of a third party or we may be required to pay damages, or both.",Legal Risk
"Further, many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim.",Legal Risk
"In addition, we have in the past been, and may in the future be, sued by third parties who seek to target us for actions taken by our customers, including through the use or misuse of our products.",Legal Risk
"For example, we have been subject to allegations in legal proceedings that we should be liable for the use of certain of our products by third parties.",Legal Risk
"Although we believe that such claims lack merit, such claims could cause reputational harm to our brand or result in liability.",Legal Risk

"For example, we are subject to ongoing securities class action litigation and related stockholder derivative claims brought against Tableau and Slack that remain outstanding, and as to which we may ultimately be subject to liability or settlement costs.",Legal Risk
"Additionally, we may have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to intellectual property or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks with respect to acquired companies or technologies.",Technology Risk
"In addition, third parties have made claims in connection with our acquisitions and may do so in the future, and they may also make infringement and similar or related claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition.",Legal Risk
"The outcome of any claims or litigation, regardless of the merits, is inherently uncertain.",Legal Risk
"Any claims or lawsuits, and the disposition of such claims and lawsuits, whether through settlement or licensing discussions, or litigation, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, divert management attention from executing our business plan, result in efforts to enjoin our activities, lead to attempts on the part of other parties to pursue similar claims and, in the case of intellectual property claims, require us to change our technology, change our business practices, pay monetary damages or enter into short- or long-term royalty or licensing agreements.",Legal Risk
"Any adverse determination or settlement related to intellectual property claims or other litigation could prevent us from offering our services to others, could be material to our financial condition or cash flows, or both, or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results, including our operating cash flow in a particular period.",Legal Risk
"In addition, depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute, an unfavorable resolution of a legal matter could materially affect our current or future results of operations or cash flows in a particular period.",Legal Risk

Similar uncertainty applies to our U.S. and international trademark registrations and applications.,Legal Risk
"Furthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain, and we also may face proposals to change the scope of protection for some intellectual property rights in the U.S. and elsewhere.",Legal Risk
"Effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our services are available and legal changes and uncertainty in various countries&#8217; intellectual property regimes may result in making conduct that we believe is lawful to be deemed violative of others&#8217; rights.",Legal Risk
"The laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the U.S., and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate.",Legal Risk
"Also, our involvement in standard-setting activity, our contribution to open source projects, various competition law regimes or the need to obtain licenses from others may require us to license our intellectual property in certain circumstances.",Legal Risk
"Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property.",Legal Risk

"As a result, most of the revenue we report in each quarter is the result of subscription and support agreements entered into during previous quarters.",General Risk
"Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one quarter may not be reflected in our revenue results for that quarter but will negatively impact our revenue in future quarters.",Business Risk
"Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our services, and changes in our attrition rate, may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods.",Business Risk
"Our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription and support term.",Business Risk
"If we experience significant fluctuations in our rate of anticipated growth and fail to balance our expenses with our revenue forecasts, our business could be harmed and the market price of our common stock could decline.",Business Risk
"Due to the unpredictability of future general economic and financial market conditions, including from the global economic impact of geopolitical conflict in Europe, the pace of change and innovation in enterprise cloud computing services, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, the growing complexity of our business, including the use of multiple pricing and packaging models and the increasing amount of revenue from software license sales, and our increasing focus on enterprise cloud computing services, we may not be able to realize our projected revenue growth plans.",Market Risk
We plan our expense and investment levels based on estimates of future revenue and future anticipated rate of growth.,Market Risk
"We may not be able to adjust our spending appropriately if the addition of new subscriptions or the renewals of existing subscriptions fall short of our expectations, and unanticipated events may cause us to incur expenses beyond what we anticipated.",Financial Risk
"A portion of our expenses may also be fixed in nature for some minimum amount of time, such as with costs capitalized to obtain revenue contracts, data center and infrastructure service contracts or office leases, so it may not be possible to reduce costs in a timely manner, or at all, without the payment of fees to exit certain obligations early.",Financial Risk
"As a result, our revenues, operating results and cash flows may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and revenue growth rates may not be sustainable and may decline in the future.",Business Risk

"These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve, economic and political conditions change and evolving tax regulations come into effect.",Business Risk
The fluctuations of currencies in which we conduct business can both increase and decrease our overall revenue and expenses for any given fiscal period.,Business Risk
"Furthermore, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, combined with the seasonality of our business, could affect our ability to accurately predict our future results and earnings.",Business Risk
"Additionally, global events as well as geopolitical developments, including conflict in Europe, fluctuating commodity prices, trade tariff developments and inflation have caused, and may in the future cause, global economic uncertainty and uncertainty about the interest rate environment, which has and could in the future amplify the volatility of currency fluctuations.",Market Risk

"In addition, we may seek debt financing to fund future acquisitions.",Financial Risk
"We can offer no assurance that we can obtain debt financing on terms acceptable to us, if at all.",Financial Risk
"In addition, adverse changes by any rating agency to our credit ratings may negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities, as well as the potential costs associated with a refinancing of our debt.",Financial Risk
Downgrades in our credit ratings could also affect the terms of any such refinancing or future financing or restrict our ability to obtain additional financing in the future.,Financial Risk
The indentures governing our Senior Notes and the Revolving Loan Credit Agreement impose restrictions on us and require us to maintain compliance with specified covenants.,Financial Risk
Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control.,Financial Risk
"A failure to comply with the covenants and other provisions of our outstanding debt could result in events of default under such instruments, which could permit acceleration of all of our debt and borrowings.",Financial Risk
Any required repayment of our debt as a result of a fundamental change or other acceleration would lower our current cash on hand such that we would not have those funds available for use in our business.,Financial Risk
"Lease accounting guidance requires that we record a liability for operating lease activity on our consolidated balance sheet, which increases both our assets and liabilities and therefore may impact our ability to obtain the necessary financing from financial institutions at commercially viable rates or at all.",Financial Risk
Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease.,Financial Risk
Periods beyond the noncancellable term of the lease are included in the measurement of the lease liability and associated asset only when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the associated extension option or waive the termination option.,Financial Risk
We reassess the lease term if and when a significant event or change in circumstances occurs within our control.,Financial Risk
The potential impact of these options to extend could be material to our financial position and financial results.,Financial Risk
Current and future accounting pronouncements and other financial and nonfinancial reporting standards may negatively impact our financial results.,Financial Risk
We regularly monitor our compliance with applicable financial and nonfinancial reporting standards and review new pronouncements and interpretations that are relevant to us.,Financial Risk
"As a result of new financial or nonfinancial standards or pronouncements, changes to existing standards or pronouncements and changes in their interpretation, we may be required to change our accounting policies, to alter our operational policies, to implement new or enhance existing systems so that they reflect new or amended financial reporting standards, and to adjust our published financial statements.",Financial Risk
"For example, proposed reporting requirements such as the SEC proposals related to the enhancement and standardization of climate-related disclosures may require us to change our accounting policies, to alter our operational policies and to implement new or enhance existing systems so that they reflect new or amended financial reporting standards, or to restate our published financial statements.",Financial Risk
"Such changes may have an adverse effect on our business, financial position and operating results, or cause an adverse deviation from our revenue and operating profit targets, which may negatively impact our financial results.",Financial Risk
"Risks Related to Owning Our Common Stock 

Our quarterly results are likely to fluctuate, which may cause the value of our common stock to decline substantially.",Market Risk
Our quarterly results are likely to fluctuate.,Financial Risk
"Fluctuations have occurred due to known and unknown risks, such as the sudden and unanticipated effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and rising interest rates.",Financial Risk
"In addition, our fiscal fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals, and the year-over-year compounding effect of this seasonality in billing patterns and overall new business and renewal activity causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter to continually increase in proportion to our billings in the other three quarters of our fiscal year.",Financial Risk
"As a result, our fiscal first quarter has typically in the past been our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter.",Financial Risk
"Additionally, some of the important factors that may cause our revenues, operating results and cash flows to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include:

&#8226; the impact of new accounting pronouncements and associated system implementations.",General Risk
"Many of these factors are outside of our control, and the occurrence of one or more of them might cause our operating results to vary widely.",Financial Risk
"If we fail to meet or exceed operating results expectations or if securities analysts and investors have estimates and forecasts of our future performance that are unrealistic or that we do not meet, the market price of our common stock could decline.",Market Risk

"Some companies that have experienced volatility in the trading price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation, such as the securities litigation against Slack that was brought before our acquisition.",Security Risk
"Such litigation, whether against Salesforce or an acquired subsidiary, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management&#8217;s attention and resources and liability resulting from or the settlement of such litigation could result in material adverse impacts to our operating cash flows or results of operations for a given period.",Legal Risk

"In particular, although most of our offices have reopened, we have offered a significant percentage of our employees the flexibility in the amount of time they work in an office.",Technology Risk
This presents risks for our real estate portfolio and strategy and presents operational and workplace culture challenges that may adversely affect our business.,Business Risk
"Even as the pandemic moves into endemic stages, our employees may be exposed to health risks and government directives may require us to again close certain of our offices that have since been reopened.",Business Risk
"Our operations were negatively affected by a range of external factors related to the COVID-19 pandemic that are not within our control, and COVID-19 remains a public health emergency in certain parts of the world, which could impact the operations of our business infrastructure and service providers in such parts of the world and delay our security measures, business processes, product development and foreign investments.",Business Risk
"As we continue to monitor the situation and public health guidance throughout the world, we may adjust our current policies and practices, and existing and new precautionary measures could negatively affect our operations.",Business Risk

"Volatile and significantly weakened global economic conditions have in the past and may in the future adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations.",Business Risk
Our overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic and geopolitical conditions.,Market Risk
"The United States and other key international economies have experienced significant economic and market downturns in the past, and are likely to experience additional cyclical downturns from time to time in which economic activity is impacted by falling demand for a variety of goods and services, restricted credit, poor liquidity, reduced corporate profitability, volatility in credit, equity and foreign exchange markets, inflation, bankruptcies and overall uncertainty with respect to the economy.",Market Risk
"These economic conditions can arise suddenly, as did the conditions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, and the full impact of such conditions can be difficult to predict.",Market Risk
"In addition, geopolitical and domestic political developments, such as existing and potential trade wars and other events beyond our control, such as conflict in Europe, have increased levels of political and economic unpredictability globally and increase the volatility of global financial markets.",Market Risk
"Moreover, these conditions have affected and may continue to affect the rate of IT spending; could adversely affect our customers&#8217; ability or willingness to attend our events or to purchase our enterprise cloud computing services; have delayed and may delay customer purchasing decisions; have reduced and may in the future reduce the value and duration of customer subscription contracts; and we expect these conditions will adversely affect our customer attrition rates.",Technology Risk

"Our corporate headquarters, and a significant portion of our personnel, research and development activities, IT systems and other critical business operations, are located near major seismic faults in the San Francisco Bay Area.",Business Risk
"Because we do not carry earthquake insurance for direct earthquake-related losses, with the exception of the building that we own in San Francisco, and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations, our financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or catastrophic event, and the adverse effects of any such catastrophic event would be exacerbated if experienced at the same time as another unexpected and adverse event.",Financial Risk
"For example, wildfires have resulted in power shut-offs in the San Francisco Bay Area and are likely to occur in the future, and this could adversely affect the work-from-home operations of our employees in the San Francisco Bay Area.",Business Risk
Climate change may have an impact on our business.,Business Risk
"While we seek to mitigate our business risks associated with climate change by establishing robust environmental programs and partnering with organizations who are also focused on mitigating their own climate-related risks, we recognize 

that there are inherent climate-related risks wherever business is conducted.",Business Risk
Any of our primary locations may be vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change.,General Risk
"For example, our offices globally have historically experienced, and are projected to continue to experience, climate-related events at an increasing frequency, including drought, water scarcity, heat waves, cold waves, flooding, wildfires and resultant air quality impacts and power shutoffs associated with wildfire prevention.",General Risk
"Furthermore, it is more difficult to mitigate the impact of these events on our employees to the extent they work from home.",Business Risk
"Changing market dynamics, global policy developments and the increasing frequency and impact of extreme weather events on critical infrastructure in the United States and elsewhere have the potential to disrupt our business, the business of third-party providers or suppliers that we rely on to conduct our business and the business of our customers, and may cause us to experience higher attrition, losses and additional costs to maintain or resume operations.",Business Risk
"Additionally, failure to uphold, meet or make timely forward progress against our public commitments and goals related to climate action could adversely affect our reputation with investors, suppliers and customers, our financial performance or our ability to recruit and retain talent.",Business Risk

"Global macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions affect us, our clients&#8217; businesses and the markets they serve.",Market Risk
"Volatile, negative and uncertain economic and political conditions have in the past undermined and could in the future undermine business confidence in our significant markets and other markets, which are increasingly interdependent, causing our clients to reduce or defer their spending on new initiatives and technologies, and resulting in clients reducing, delaying or eliminating spending under existing contracts with us, which negatively affects our business.",Market Risk
"Growth in the markets we serve could be at a slow rate, or could stagnate or contract, in each case, for an extended period of time.",Market Risk
"Because we operate globally and have significant businesses in many markets, an economic slowdown in any of those markets could adversely affect our results of operations.",Business Risk
"Ongoing economic and political volatility and uncertainty and changing demand patterns affect our business in a number of other ways, including making it more difficult to accurately forecast client demand and effectively build our revenue and resource plans, particularly in consulting.",Business Risk
Economic and political volatility and uncertainty is particularly challenging because it may take some time for the effects and changes in demand patterns resulting from these and other factors to manifest themselves in our business and results of operations.,Business Risk
"Changing demand patterns from economic and political volatility and uncertainty, including as a result of increasing geopolitical tensions, inflation, economic downturns, changes in global trade policies, global health emergencies and their impact on us, our clients and the industries we serve, could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations.",Business Risk
"Our business depends on generating and maintaining client demand for our services and solutions, including through the adaptation and expansion of our services and solutions in response to ongoing changes in technology and offerings, and a significant reduction in such demand or an inability to respond to the evolving technological environment could materially affect our results of operations.",Business Risk
"Our financial results depend in part on the demand for our services and solutions, which could be negatively affected by numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control and unrelated to our work product.",Financial Risk
"As described above, volatile, negative or uncertain global economic and political conditions and lower growth or contraction in the markets we serve have adversely affected and could in the future adversely affect client demand for our services and solutions.",Market Risk

Technological developments may materially affect the cost and use of technology by our clients and, in the case of cloud and as-a-service solutions, could affect the nature of how we generate revenue.",Technology Risk
Some of these technological developments have reduced and replaced some of our historical services and solutions and may continue to do so in the future.,Technology Risk
"This has caused, and may in the future cause, clients to delay spending under existing contracts and engagements and to delay entering into new contracts while they evaluate new technologies.",Technology Risk
Such technological developments and spending delays can negatively impact our results of operations if we are unable to introduce new pricing or commercial models that reflect the value of these technological developments or if the pace and level of spending on new technologies are not sufficient to make up any shortfall.,Technology Risk
"Developments in the industries we serve, which may be rapid, also could shift demand to new services and solutions.",Market Risk
"If, as a result of new technologies or changes in the industries we serve, our clients demand new services and solutions, we may be less competitive in these new areas or need to make significant investment to meet that demand.",Technology Risk
Our growth strategy focuses on responding to these types of developments by driving innovation that will enable us to expand our business into new growth areas.,Market Risk
"If we do not sufficiently invest in new technology and adapt to industry developments, or evolve and expand our business at sufficient speed and scale, or if we do not make the right strategic investments to respond to these developments and successfully drive innovation, our services and solutions, our results of operations, and our ability to develop and maintain a competitive advantage and to execute on our growth strategy could be adversely affected.",Technology Risk
"In a particular geographic market, service or industry group, a small number of clients have contributed, or may, in the future contribute, a significant portion of the revenues of such geographic market, service or industry group, and any decision by such a client to delay, reduce, or eliminate spending on our services and solutions could have a disproportionate impact on the results of operations in the relevant geographic market, service or industry group.",Market Risk
"Many of our consulting contracts are less than 12 months in duration, and these contracts typically permit a client to terminate the agreement with as little as 30 days&#8217; notice.",Legal Risk
"Longer-term, larger and more complex contracts, such as the majority of our outsourcing contracts, generally require a longer notice period for termination and often include an early termination charge to be paid to us, but this charge might not be sufficient to cover our costs or make up for anticipated ongoing revenues and profits lost upon termination of the contract.",Financial Risk
"Many of our contracts allow clients to terminate, delay, reduce or eliminate spending on the services and solutions we provide.",Financial Risk
"Additionally, a client could choose not to retain us for additional stages of a project, try to renegotiate the terms of its contract or cancel or delay additional planned work.",Business Risk
"When contracts are terminated or not renewed, we lose the anticipated revenues, and it may take significant time to replace the level of revenues lost.",Business Risk
"Consequently, our results of operations in subsequent periods could be materially lower than expected.",Business Risk
"The specific business or financial condition of a client, changes in management and changes in a client&#8217;s strategy are also all factors that can result in terminations, cancellations or delays.",Business Risk
"If we are unable to match people and their skills with client demand around the world and attract and retain professionals with strong leadership skills, our business, the utilization rate of our professionals and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected.",Business Risk
"Our success is dependent, in large part, on our ability to keep our people with market-leading skills and capabilities in balance with client demand around the world and our ability to attract and retain people with the knowledge and skills to lead our business globally.",Market Risk
"We must hire or reskill, retain and inspire appropriate numbers of talented people with diverse skills in order to serve clients across the globe, respond quickly to rapid and ongoing changes in demand, technology, industry and the macroeconomic environment, and continuously innovate to grow our business.",Market Risk
"For example, if we are unable to hire or retrain our employees to keep pace with the rapid and continuous changes in technology and the industries we serve, we may not be able to innovate and deliver new services and solutions to fulfill client demand.",Technology Risk
"There is competition for scarce talent with market-leading skills and capabilities in new technologies, and our people have been directly targeted because of their highly sought-after skills and this will likely continue.",Market Risk
"There is a risk that at certain points in time, we may have more people than we need in certain skill sets or geographies or at compensation levels that are not aligned with skill sets.",Business Risk
"In these situations, we have engaged, and may in the future engage, in actions to rebalance our workforce, including reducing the rate of new hires and increasing involuntary terminations as a means to keep our supply of people and skills in balance with client demand.",Business Risk
"At certain times and in certain geographical regions, we will find it difficult to hire and retain a sufficient number of employees with the skills or backgrounds to meet current and/or future demand.",Market Risk
"In these cases, we might need to redeploy existing people or increase our reliance on subcontractors to fill certain labor needs.",Business Risk
"If we are not successful in these initiatives, our results of operations could be adversely affected.",Business Risk

Our equity-based incentive compensation plans are designed to reward high-performing individuals for their contributions and provide incentives for them to remain with us.,General Risk
"If the anticipated value of such incentives does not materialize because of volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price, or if our total compensation package is not viewed as being competitive, our ability to attract and retain the people we need could be adversely affected.",Business Risk
"In addition, if we do not obtain the shareholder approval needed to continue granting equity awards under our share plans in the amounts we believe are necessary, our ability to attract and retain people could be negatively affected.",Business Risk

"Unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had an adverse effect, and could in the future have a material adverse effect, on our results of operations.",Business Risk
"Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues, expenses and income, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period.",Financial Risk
"Therefore, changes in the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies will affect our revenues, operating income and the value of balance-sheet items, including intercompany payables and receivables, originally denominated in other currencies.",Financial Risk
These changes cause our growth stated in U.S. dollars to be higher or lower than our growth in local currency when compared against other periods.,Market Risk
"Our currency hedging programs, which are designed to partially offset the impact on consolidated earnings related to the changes in value of certain balance sheet items, might not be successful.",Financial Risk
"Additionally, some transactions and balances may be denominated in currencies for which there is no available market to hedge.",Financial Risk
"As we continue to leverage our global delivery model, more of our expenses are incurred in currencies other than those in which we bill for the related services.",Market Risk

"Ongoing business may be disrupted, and our management&#8217;s attention may be diverted by acquisition, investment, transition or integration activities.",Business Risk
"In addition, we might need to dedicate additional management and other resources, and our organizational structure could make it difficult for us to efficiently integrate acquired businesses into our ongoing operations and assimilate and retain employees of those businesses into our culture and operations.",Business Risk
"The loss of key executives, employees, customers, suppliers, vendors and other business partners of businesses we acquire may adversely impact the value of the assets, operations or businesses.",Business Risk
"Furthermore, acquisitions or joint ventures may result in significant costs and expenses, including those related to retention payments, equity compensation, severance pay, early retirement costs, intangible asset amortization and asset impairment charges, enhancing controls, procedures and policies including those related to financial reporting, disclosure, and cyber and information security, assumed litigation and other liabilities, and legal, accounting and financial advisory fees, which could negatively affect our profitability as these costs and expenses grow along with the increased capital invested in such acquisitions and joint ventures.",Security Risk

The number of transactions we execute annually may increase this risk.,Security Risk
"If any of these circumstances occurs, they could result in unexpected regulatory or legal exposure, including litigation with new or existing clients, unfavorable accounting treatment, unexpected increases in taxes or other adverse effects on our relationships with clients and our business.",Legal Risk
"In addition, we have a lesser degree of control over the business operations of the joint ventures and businesses in which we have made minority investments or in which we have acquired less than 100% of the equity.",Business Risk
"This lesser degree of control may expose us to additional reputational, financial, legal, compliance or operational risks.",Legal Risk

"For example, by taking over the operation of certain portions of our clients&#8217; businesses, including functions and systems that are critical to the core businesses of our clients, by contributing to the design, development and/or engineering of client products, or by providing various operational technology, digital manufacturing and robotics solutions, we may be exposed to additional and evolving operational, regulatory, reputational or other risks specific to these areas, including risks related to data security.",Security Risk
A failure of a client&#8217;s system based on our services or solutions could also subject us to a claim for significant damages that could materially adversely affect our results of operations.,Business Risk
"In order to remain competitive, we increasingly enter into agreements based on our clients&#8217; contract terms after conducting an assessment of the risk of doing so, which may expose us to additional risk.",Financial Risk
"In addition, the contracting practices of competitors, along with the demands of increasingly sophisticated clients, may cause contract terms and conditions that are unfavorable to us to become new standards in the industry.",Market Risk
We may commit to providing services or solutions that we are unable to deliver or whose delivery may reduce our profitability or cause us financial loss.,Business Risk
"If we cannot or do not meet our contractual obligations and if our potential liability is not adequately limited through the terms of our agreements, liability limitations are not enforced or a third party alleges fraud or other wrongdoing to prevent us from relying upon those contractual protections, we might face significant legal liability and litigation expense and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.",Legal Risk
"Moreover, as we expand our services and solutions into new areas, we may be exposed to additional and evolving risks specific to these new areas.",Security Risk

"For example, as a result of the sanctions imposed in response to the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, we were restricted from offering certain of our services to clients in some locations.",Business Risk
"The global nature of our operations, including emerging markets where legal systems may be less developed or understood by us, and the diverse nature of our operations across a number of regulated industries, further increase the difficulty of compliance.",Legal Risk
"Compliance with diverse legal requirements is costly, time-consuming and requires significant resources.",Legal Risk

"Due to the varying degrees of development of the legal systems of the countries in which we operate, local laws may not be well developed or provide sufficiently clear guidance and may be insufficient to protect our rights.",Legal Risk
"In particular, in many parts of the world, including countries in which we operate and/or seek to expand, practices in the local business community might not conform to international business standards and could violate anticorruption laws, or regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K.",Legal Risk

Changes in laws and regulations could also mandate significant and costly changes to the way we implement our services and solutions or could impose additional taxes on our services and solutions.",Legal Risk
"For example, changes in laws and regulations to limit using off-shore resources in connection with our work or to penalize companies that use off-shore resources, which have been proposed from time to time in various jurisdictions, could adversely affect our results of operations.",Legal Risk
"Such changes may result in contracts being terminated or work being transferred onshore, resulting in greater costs to us, and could have a negative impact on our ability to obtain future work from government clients.",Business Risk
"In addition, several jurisdictions where we operate have proposed legislation regulating artificial intelligence and non-personal data that may impose significant requirements on how we design, build and deploy artificial intelligence and handle non-personal data for ourselves and our clients.",Legal Risk
Our work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment.,Security Risk
"Our clients include national, provincial, state and local governmental entities.",General Risk
Our government work carries various risks inherent in the government contracting process.,Security Risk
"These risks include, but are not limited to, the following: 

&#8226; Government entities, particularly in the United States, often reserve the right to audit our contract costs and conduct inquiries and investigations of our business practices and compliance with government contract requirements.",Business Risk
"U.S. government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency, routinely audit our contract costs, including allocated indirect costs, for compliance with the Cost Accounting Standards and the Federal Acquisition Regulation.",General Risk
"These agencies also conduct reviews and investigations and make inquiries regarding our accounting, information technology and other systems in connection with our performance and business practices with respect to our government contracts.",Technology Risk
"Negative findings from existing and future audits, investigations or inquiries, or failure to comply with applicable IT security or supply chain requirements, could affect our future sales and profitability by preventing us, by operation of law or in practice, from receiving new government contracts for some period of time.",Security Risk
"In addition, if the U.S. government concludes that certain costs are not reimbursable, have not been properly determined or are based on outdated estimates of our work, then we will not be allowed to bill for such costs, may have to refund money that has already been paid to us or could be required to retroactively and prospectively adjust previously agreed to billing or pricing rates for our work.",Legal Risk
"Negative findings from existing and future audits of our business systems, including our accounting system, may result in the U.S. government preventing us from billing, at least temporarily, a percentage of our costs.",Business Risk
"As a result of prior negative findings in connection with audits, investigations and inquiries, we have from time to time experienced some of the adverse consequences described above and may in the future experience further adverse consequences, which could materially adversely affect our future results of operations.",Business Risk
"&#8226; If a government client discovers improper or illegal activities in the course of audits or investigations, we may become subject to various civil and criminal penalties, including those under the civil U.S. False Claims Act, and administrative sanctions, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with other agencies of that government.",Legal Risk
The inherent limitations of internal controls may not prevent or detect all improper or illegal activities.,Security Risk
&#8226; U.S. government contracting regulations impose strict compliance and heightened disclosure obligations.,Security Risk
From time to time we have made disclosures.,Market Risk
"Disclosure is required if certain company personnel have knowledge of &#8220;credible evidence&#8221; of a violation of federal criminal laws involving fraud, conflict of interest, bribery or improper gratuity, a violation of the civil U.S. False Claims Act or receipt of a significant overpayment from the government.",Legal Risk
Failure to make required disclosures could be a basis for suspension and/or debarment from federal government contracting in addition to breach of the specific contract and could also impact contracting beyond the U.S. federal level.,Legal Risk
"Reported matters may also lead to audits or investigations and other civil, criminal or administrative sanctions, including those described above.",Legal Risk
&#8226; Government contracts are subject to heightened reputational and contractual risks compared to contracts with commercial clients.,Security Risk
"For example, government contracts and the proceedings surrounding them are often subject to more extensive scrutiny and publicity.",Legal Risk
"Negative publicity, including an allegation of improper or illegal activity, regardless of its accuracy, may adversely affect our reputation.",Legal Risk
&#8226; Terms and conditions of government contracts also tend to be more onerous and are often more difficult to negotiate.,Legal Risk
"For example, these contracts often contain high or unlimited liability for breaches and feature less favorable payment terms and sometimes require us to take on liability for the performance of third parties.",Legal Risk
&#8226; Government entities typically fund projects through appropriated monies.,General Risk
"While these projects are often planned and executed as multi-year projects, government entities usually reserve the right to change the scope of or terminate these projects for lack of approved funding and/or at their convenience.",General Risk
"Changes in government or political developments, including budget deficits, shortfalls or uncertainties, government spending reductions or other debt constraints could result in our projects being reduced in price or scope or terminated altogether, which also could limit our recovery of incurred costs, reimbursable expenses and profits on work completed prior to the termination.",Business Risk
"Furthermore, if insufficient funding is appropriated to the government entity to cover termination costs, we may not be able to fully recover our investments.",Financial Risk

&#8226; Political and economic factors such as pending elections, the outcome of recent elections, changes in leadership among key executive or legislative decision makers, revisions to governmental tax or other policies and reduced tax revenues can affect the number and terms of new government contracts signed or the speed at which new contracts are signed, decrease future levels of spending and authorizations for programs that we bid, shift spending priorities to programs in areas for which we do not provide services and/or lead to changes in enforcement or how compliance with relevant rules or laws is assessed.",General Risk
&#8226; Our ability to work for the U.S. government is impacted by the fact that we are an Irish company.,Legal Risk
We elected to enter into a proxy agreement with the U.S. Department of Defense that enhances the ability of our U.S. federal government contracting subsidiary to perform certain work for the U.S. government.,Security Risk
"The proxy agreement regulates the management and operation of, and limits the control we can exercise over, this subsidiary.",Legal Risk
"In addition, legislative and executive proposals remain under consideration or could be proposed in the future, which, if enacted, could place additional limitations on or even prohibit our eligibility to be awarded state or federal government contracts in the United States or could include requirements that would otherwise affect our results of operations.",Legal Risk
Various U.S. federal and state legislative proposals have been introduced and/or enacted in recent years that deny government contracts to certain U.S. companies that reincorporate or have reincorporated outside the United States.,Security Risk
"While Accenture was not a U.S. company that reincorporated outside the United States, it is possible that these contract bans and other legislative proposals could be applied in a way that negatively affects Accenture.",Legal Risk
"The occurrences or conditions described above could affect not only our business with the particular government entities involved, but also our business with other entities of the same or other governmental bodies or with certain commercial clients, and could have a material adverse effect on our business or our results of operations.",Business Risk
"If we are unable to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, or if our services or solutions infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or we lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others, our business could be adversely affected.",Business Risk
"Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to obtain intellectual property protection for our proprietary platforms, methodologies, processes, software and other solutions.",Legal Risk
"Existing laws of the various countries in which we provide services or solutions may offer only limited intellectual property protection of our services or solutions, and the protection in some countries may be very limited.",Legal Risk
"We rely upon a combination of confidentiality policies and procedures, nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements, and patent, trade secret, copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights.",Legal Risk
These laws are subject to change at any time and could further limit our ability to obtain or maintain intellectual property protection.,Legal Risk
"There is uncertainty concerning the scope of patent and other intellectual property protection for software and business methods, which are fields in which we rely on intellectual property laws to protect our rights.",Legal Risk
"Even where we obtain intellectual property protection, our intellectual property rights may not prevent or deter competitors, former employees, or other third parties from reverse engineering our solutions or proprietary methodologies and processes or independently developing services or solutions similar to or duplicative of ours.",Legal Risk
"Further, the steps we take in this regard might not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property by competitors, former employees or other third parties, and we might not be able to detect unauthorized use of, or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce, our intellectual property rights.",Legal Risk
"Enforcing our rights might also require considerable time, money and oversight, and we may not be successful in enforcing our rights.",Legal Risk
"In addition, we cannot be sure that our services and solutions, including, for example, our software solutions, or the solutions of others that we offer to our clients, do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties (including competitors as well as non-practicing holders of intellectual property assets), and these third parties could claim that we or our clients are infringing upon their intellectual property rights.",Legal Risk
"Furthermore, although we have established policies and procedures to respect the intellectual property rights of third parties and that prohibit the unauthorized use of intellectual property, we may not be aware if our employees have misappropriated and/or misused intellectual property, and their actions could result in claims of intellectual property misappropriation and/or infringement from third parties.",Legal Risk
"These claims could harm our reputation, cause us to incur substantial costs or prevent us from offering some services or solutions in the future.",Legal Risk
Any related proceedings could require us to expend significant resources over an extended period of time.,Legal Risk
"In most of our contracts, we agree to indemnify our clients for expenses and liabilities resulting from claimed infringements of the intellectual property rights of third parties.",Legal Risk
"In some instances, the amount of these indemnities could be greater than the revenues we receive from the client.",Financial Risk
"Any claims or litigation in this area could be time-consuming and costly, damage our reputation and/or require us to incur additional costs to obtain the right to continue to offer a service or solution to our clients.",Legal Risk
"If we cannot secure this right at all or on reasonable terms, or we are unable to implement in a cost-effective manner alternative technology, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.",Business Risk
The risk of infringement claims against us may increase as we expand our industry software solutions and continue to develop and license our software to multiple clients.,Legal Risk
Any infringement action brought against us or our clients could be costly to defend or lead to an expensive settlement or judgment against us.,Legal Risk
"Further, we rely on third-party software and other intellectual property in providing some of our services and solutions.",Technology Risk
"If we lose our ability to continue using any such software or intellectual property for any reason, including because it is found to

Our inability to replace such software or intellectual property effectively or in a timely and cost-effective manner could materially adversely affect our results of operations.,Business Risk
We are incorporated in Ireland and Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and might afford less protection to our shareholders.,Legal Risk
We may also be subject to criticism and negative publicity related to our incorporation in Ireland.,Legal Risk
Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and our shareholders could have more difficulty protecting their interests than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the United States.,Legal Risk
The United States currently does not have a treaty with Ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters.,Legal Risk
"As such, there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of Ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on U.S. federal or state civil liability laws, including the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws, or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws.",Legal Risk
"As an Irish company, we are governed by the Companies Act.",Legal Risk
"The Companies Act differs in some significant, and possibly material, respects from laws applicable to U.S. corporations and shareholders under various state corporation laws, including the provisions relating to interested directors, mergers and acquisitions, takeovers, shareholder lawsuits and indemnification of directors.",Legal Risk
"Under Irish law, the duties of directors and officers of a company are generally owed to the company only.",Legal Risk
"Shareholders of Irish companies do not generally have rights to take action against directors or officers of the company under Irish law, and may only do so in limited circumstances.",Legal Risk
"Directors of an Irish company must, in exercising their powers and performing their duties, act with due care and skill, honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the company.",Legal Risk
Directors have a duty not to put themselves in a position in which their duties to the company and their personal interests might conflict and also are under a duty to disclose any personal interest in any contract or arrangement with the company or any of its subsidiaries.,Legal Risk
"If a director or officer of an Irish company is found to have breached his or her duties to that company, he or she could be held personally liable to the company in respect of that breach of duty.",Legal Risk
"Under Irish law, we must have authority from our shareholders to issue any shares, including shares that are part of the company&#8217;s authorized but unissued share capital.",Legal Risk
"In addition, unless otherwise authorized by its shareholders, when an Irish company issues shares for cash to new shareholders, it is required first to offer those shares on the same or more favorable terms to existing shareholders on a pro-rata basis.",Legal Risk
"If we are unable to obtain these authorizations from our shareholders, or are otherwise limited by the terms of our authorizations, our ability to issue shares under our equity compensation plans and, if applicable, to facilitate funding acquisitions or otherwise raise capital could be adversely affected.",Business Risk
Some companies that conduct substantial business in the United States but that have a parent domiciled in certain other jurisdictions have been criticized as improperly avoiding U.S. taxes or creating an unfair competitive advantage over U.S. companies.,Legal Risk

The risks described below are not exhaustive and you should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our securities.,Security Risk
"Business and Operational Risks 

We may be unsuccessful in developing and selling new products and services, integrating acquired products and services and enhancing our existing products and services.",Business Risk
"Rapid technological advances, intense competition, changing delivery models and evolving standards in computer hardware and software development and communications infrastructure, changing and increasingly sophisticated customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements characterize the industries in which we compete.",Technology Risk
"If we are unable to develop new or sufficiently differentiated products and services, enhance and improve our product offerings and support services in a timely manner or position and price our products and services to meet demand, customers may not purchase or subscribe to our license, hardware or cloud offerings or renew license support, hardware support or cloud subscriptions contracts.",Market Risk
Renewals of these contracts are important to our future success.,General Risk
"In addition, we cannot provide any assurance that the standards on which we choose to develop new products will allow us to compete effectively for business opportunities in emerging areas.",Market Risk
We have continued to refresh and release new offerings of our cloud products and services.,Market Risk
"Machine learning and AI are increasingly driving innovations in technology, but if they fail to operate as anticipated or our other products do not perform as promised, our business and reputation may be harmed.",Technology Risk
"In addition, our business may be adversely affected if: 

&#8226; we do not continue to develop and release new or enhanced products and services within the anticipated time frames;

"We provide our cloud and other offerings to customers worldwide via a variety of deployment models, including via our cloud-based SaaS and OCI offerings.",Market Risk
"As these business models continue to evolve, we may not be able to compete effectively, generate significant revenues or maintain the profitability of our cloud offerings.",Business Risk
"Additionally, the increasing prevalence of cloud and SaaS delivery models offered by us and our competitors may unfavorably impact the pricing of our cloud and license offerings.",Market Risk
"If we do not successfully execute our cloud computing strategy or anticipate the cloud computing needs of our customers, our reputation as a cloud services provider could be harmed and our revenues and profitability could decline.",Business Risk
"As customer demand for our cloud offerings increases, we experience volatility in our reported revenues and operating results due to the differences in timing of revenue recognition between our cloud license and on-premise license, and hardware product arrangements relative to our cloud offering arrangements.",Technology Risk
Customers predominantly purchase our cloud offerings on a subscription basis and revenues from these offerings are generally recognized ratably or as services are consumed over the terms of the subscriptions.,Technology Risk
"Consequently, any deterioration in sales activity associated with our cloud offerings may not be immediately observable in our consolidated statement of operations.",Technology Risk
"This is in contrast to revenues associated with our license and hardware product arrangements, which are generally recognized in full at the time of delivery of the related licenses and hardware products.",Legal Risk
"In addition, we may not be able to accurately anticipate customer transitions from or be able to sufficiently backfill reduced customer demand for our license, hardware and support offerings relative to the expected increase in customer adoption of and demand for our Oracle Cloud Services, which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.",Business Risk
"As a part of our Oracle Cloud strategy, we plan our investment levels based on estimates of future revenues and future anticipated rates of growth.",Market Risk
"In recent periods, our cloud services and license support expenses have grown to meet current and expected demand for our cloud offerings, including investments to increase our existing data center capacity and to establish data centers in new geographic locations.",Technology Risk
"In connection with these investments, we entered, and expect to continue to enter, into long-term operating lease commitments with third party data center providers that generally require us to pay significant contract termination fees to early exit such obligations should our strategies change, which could adversely impact our profitability and cash flows.",Business Risk
"In addition, we outfit these data centers with equipment and improvements that we typically depreciate over their estimated useful lives, which could be shortened should our cloud strategies change, which could adversely affect our profitability.",Technology Risk
"Our products and services may not function properly if we experience significant coding, manufacturing or configuration errors in our cloud, license and hardware offerings.",Technology Risk
"Despite testing prior to the release and throughout the lifecycle of a product or service, our cloud, license and hardware offerings sometimes contain coding, manufacturing or configuration errors that can impact their function, performance and security, and result in other negative consequences.",Security Risk
"The detection and correction of any errors in released cloud, license or hardware offerings can be time consuming and costly.",Technology Risk
"Errors in our cloud, license or hardware offerings could affect their ability to properly function, integrate or operate with other cloud, license or hardware offerings, could result in service interruptions, delays or outages of our cloud offerings, could create security vulnerabilities in our products or services, could delay the development or release of new products or services or new versions of products or services, and could adversely affect market acceptance of our products or services.",Security Risk
This includes third-party software products or services incorporated into our own.,Technology Risk
"If we experience any of these errors, or if there are delays in releasing our cloud, license or hardware offerings or new versions of these offerings, our sales could be affected and revenues could decline.",Business Risk
"In addition, we run Oracle&#8217;s business operations as well as cloud and other services that we offer to our customers on our products and networks.",Technology Risk

"The nature of the IT industry creates a competitive landscape that is constantly evolving as firms emerge, expand or are acquired, as technology evolves and as delivery models change.",Technology Risk
"Our enterprise cloud, license and hardware offerings compete directly with certain offerings from some of the largest and most competitive companies in the world.",Market Risk
"In addition, due to the low barriers to entry in many of our market segments, new technologies and new and growing competitors frequently emerge to challenge our offerings.",Technology Risk
"We believe many vendors spend amounts in excess of what Oracle spends to develop and market applications and infrastructure technologies including databases, middleware products, application development tools, business applications, collaboration products and business intelligence, compute, storage and networking products, among others, which compete with Oracle applications and infrastructure offerings.",Market Risk
"In addition, use of our competitors&#8217; technologies can influence a customer&#8217;s purchasing decision or create an environment that makes it less efficient to utilize or migrate to Oracle products and services.",Technology Risk
"For example, we offer our customers multicloud services whereby our customers can combine cloud services from multiple clouds with the goal of optimizing cost, functionality and performance.",Business Risk
"OCI&#8217;s multicloud services work with a number of our competitors&#8217; products, including Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform.",Technology Risk
"This multicloud strategy could lead our customers to migrate away from our cloud offerings to our competitors&#8217; products, which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.",Business Risk
"Our competitors may also adopt business practices that provide customers access to competing products and services on terms that we may not generally find acceptable, which may convince customers to purchase competitor products and services.",Business Risk
"We could lose customers if our competitors introduce new competitive products, add new functionality, acquire competitive products, reduce prices, better execute on their sales and marketing strategies, offer more flexible business practices, provide debt or equity financing to customers or form strategic alliances with other companies.",Business Risk
"Mergers, consolidations or alliances among our competitors, or acquisitions of our competitors by large companies may result in increased competition.",Market Risk
"If our competitors offer deep discounts on certain products or services or develop products that the marketplace considers more valuable, we may need to lower prices, introduce pricing models and offerings or offer other terms that are less favorable to us, in order to compete successfully.",Market Risk
Any such changes may reduce revenues and margins and could adversely affect operating results.,Business Risk
"Additionally, the increasing prevalence of cloud delivery models offered by us and our competitors may unfavorably impact the pricing of our other cloud and license, hardware and services offerings, and we may also incur increased cloud delivery expenses as we expand our cloud operations and update our infrastructure, all of which could reduce our revenues and profitability.",Technology Risk
"Our license support fees and hardware support fees are generally priced as a percentage of our net license fees and net new hardware products fees, respectively.",Security Risk
"Our competitors may offer lower pricing on their support offerings, which could put pressure on us to further discount our offerings.",Market Risk
Changes to our prices and pricing policies could cause our revenues to decline or be delayed as our sales force implements and our customers adjust to the new pricing policies.,Business Risk
"Some of our competitors may bundle products for promotional purposes or as a long-term pricing strategy, commit to large customer deployments at prices that are unprofitable, or provide guarantees of prices and product implementations.",Market Risk
"These practices could, over time, significantly constrain the prices that we can charge for certain of our products.",Business Risk
"If we do not adapt our pricing models to reflect changes in customer use of our products or changes in customer demand, our revenues could decrease.",Business Risk
The increase in open source software distribution may also cause us to change our pricing models.,Technology Risk
Any failure to offer high-quality technical support services may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our financial results .,Business Risk
Our customers depend on our support organization to resolve technical issues relating to our applications and infrastructure offerings.,Technology Risk
We may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in customer demand for support services or may be inefficient in our resolution of customer support issues.,Business Risk

"We depend on suppliers to develop, manufacture and deliver on a timely basis the necessary technologies and components for our hardware products that we market and sell to our customers and that we use as a part of our cloud infrastructure to deliver our cloud offerings, and there are some technologies and components that can only be purchased from a single vendor due to price, quality, technology, availability or other business constraints.",Technology Risk
"Our supply chain operations could be disrupted by industry consolidation and component constraints or shortages, natural disasters, political unrest, public health crises, changes to trade laws or regulations, port stoppages or other transportation disruptions or slowdowns, or other factors affecting the countries or regions where these single source component vendors are located or where the products are being shipped (such as the tensions between China and Taiwan).",Market Risk
"If one or more of the risks described above occurs, our cloud and license business and hardware business and related operating results could be materially and adversely affected.",Business Risk
Supply chain shortages have in some instances resulted in increases to the costs of production of our hardware products that we may not be able to pass on to our customers.,Business Risk
"In addition, we have in some instances responded to such shortages by committing to higher purchases and balances of hardware products that we market and sell to our customers and that we use as a part of our cloud infrastructure to deliver our cloud offerings, relative to our historical positions.",Business Risk
"While this permits us to secure manufacturing capacity, it has increased excess and obsolescence risk of such hardware products and could adversely impact our profitability and cash flows.",Business Risk
We expect these factors will continue to impact us in the future.,Financial Risk
"We outsource a majority of our manufacturing, assembly, delivery and technology of, and certain component designs for, our hardware products to a variety of companies, many of which are located outside the U.S. From time to time, these partners experience production problems, delays or cannot meet our demand for products.",Business Risk
"Ongoing or future delays in manufacturing could cause the loss of additional sales, delayed revenue recognition or an increase in our hardware products expenses, all of which could adversely affect the margins of our cloud and license business and hardware business.",Business Risk
"These challenges could arise if we alter our manufacturing strategies, suppliers, or locations.",Business Risk
Our periodic workforce restructurings and reorganizations can be disruptive.,Business Risk
"We are currently restructuring our workforce and in the past we have restructured or made other adjustments to our workforce in response to management changes, product changes, performance issues, changes in strategies, acquisitions and other internal and external considerations.",General Risk
"These types of restructurings have resulted, and may in the future result, in increased restructuring costs and temporary reduced productivity while the employees adjusted to their new roles and responsibilities.",Business Risk
These types of restructurings may also lead to a shortage of sufficiently skilled employees in certain roles.,Market Risk
"In addition, we may not achieve or sustain the expected growth, resource redeployment or cost savings benefits of these restructurings, or may not do so within the expected timeframe.",Business Risk
"These effects could recur in connection with future acquisitions and other restructurings, and our revenues and other results of operations could be negatively affected.",Business Risk
We may lose key employees or may be unable to hire enough qualified employees.,Business Risk

We may not be successful in recruiting new personnel and in retaining and motivating existing personnel.,Market Risk
"With rare exceptions, we do not have long-term employment or non-competition agreements with our employees.",General Risk
"Members of our senior management team have left Oracle over the years for a variety of reasons, and any future departures may be disruptive to our operations.",Business Risk
We continually focus on improving our cost structure by hiring personnel in countries where advanced technical expertise and other expertise are available at lower costs.,Security Risk
"When we make adjustments to our workforce, we may incur expenses associated with workforce reductions that delay the benefit of a more efficient workforce structure.",Business Risk
"We are experiencing increased competition for employees in these countries as the trend toward globalization continues, which has affected our employee retention efforts and increased our expenses in an effort to offer a competitive compensation program.",Business Risk
"In addition, changes to immigration and labor law policies may adversely impact our access to technical and professional talent.",Legal Risk

"We and our third-party vendors are regularly subject to attempts by third parties (which may include individuals or groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, such as state-sponsored organizations, nation-states and individuals sponsored by them) to identify and exploit product and service vulnerabilities, penetrate or bypass our security measures, and gain unauthorized access to our or our customers&#8217;, partners&#8217; and suppliers&#8217; software, hardware and cloud offerings, networks and systems.",Security Risk
Successful attempts by one of these malicious actors can lead to the compromise of personal information or the confidential information or data of Oracle or our customers.,Security Risk
"Attempts of this nature typically involve IT-related viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack networks, systems, products and services, exploit potential security vulnerabilities of networks, systems, products and services, create system disruptions and cause shutdowns or denials of service.",Security Risk

"If our customers lose confidence in the security and reliability of our products and services, including our cloud offerings, and perceive them to not be secure, they may decide to reduce or terminate their spend with us.",Security Risk
"In addition, cyber-attacks and other security incidents could lead to considerable investigation and remediation costs, loss or destruction of information, interruption of our operations, inappropriate use of proprietary and sensitive data, lawsuits, indemnity obligations, regulatory investigations and financial penalties, and claims and increased legal liability, including in some cases contractual costs related to customer notification and fraud monitoring.",Security Risk
Our remediation efforts may not be successful.,Market Risk
"Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, or sabotage IT systems, change frequently, grow more complex over time, and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate or implement adequate measures to prevent such techniques.",Security Risk
Our internal IT systems continue to evolve and we are often early adopters of new technologies.,General Risk

"We are also subject to a variety of other risks and challenges in managing an organization operating globally, including those related to: 

&#8226; general economic conditions in each country or region; 

&#8226; political unrest, terrorism and war, including but not limited to the current Russia-Ukraine war, the economic impact thereof and the potential to subject our business to materially adverse consequences should the situation escalate beyond its current scope, including, among other potential impacts, the geographic proximity of the situation relative to the rest of Europe, where a material portion of our business is carried out; 

&#8226; the potential for other hostilities, including but not limited to escalating tensions between China and Taiwan; 

&#8226; public health risks, social risks and supporting infrastructure stability risks, particularly in areas in which we have significant operations;

"Standards for reporting ESG metrics, including ESG-related disclosures that may be required by the SEC or other regulators, are complex and evolving, and the implementation and oversight of controls to comply with applicable reporting and disclosure standards could impose significant compliance costs.",Market Risk
"In addition, such disclosure requirements could result in revisions to our previous ESG-related disclosure or challenges in meeting evolving and varied regulatory and other stakeholder expectations and standards, which could expose us to liability or harm our reputation and prospects.",Market Risk
"Financial Risks 

Our operations can be difficult for us to predict because our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate significantly based on a number of factors.",Financial Risk
"Our revenues, particularly certain of our cloud license and on-premise license revenues and hardware revenues, can be difficult to forecast.",Technology Risk
"A substantial portion of our cloud license, on-premise license and hardware contracts is completed in the latter part of a quarter.",Technology Risk
"Because a significant portion of our cost structure is largely fixed in the short term, sales and revenue shortfalls tend to have a disproportionately negative impact on our profitability.",Business Risk
"The number of large license transactions and, to a lesser extent, hardware products transactions increases the risk of fluctuations in our quarterly results because a delay in even a small number of these transactions could cause our quarterly sales, revenues and profitability to fall significantly short of our predictions.",Business Risk
"In addition, sudden shifts in regional or global economic or political activity may cause our sales forecasts to be inaccurate.",Business Risk
"In addition, we hold a portfolio of publicly traded and privately held equity investments.",Market Risk
Changes in the fair values of these investments are recorded as unrealized gains or losses as a component of consolidated net income in each period.,Market Risk

foreign currency gains and losses in certain instances if it is not possible or cost-effective to hedge our foreign currency exposures, if our hedging efforts are ineffective, or should we suspend our foreign currency forward contract program.",Financial Risk
"Our ultimate realized loss or gain with respect to currency fluctuations will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency exposures that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, whether we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to offset these exposures and any related fees paid to purchase such contracts, and other factors.",Financial Risk
"All of these factors could materially impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.",Financial Risk
We have incurred foreign currency losses associated with the devaluation of currencies in certain highly inflationary economies relative to the U.S. Dollar.,Business Risk

We may also need to refinance a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures.,Financial Risk
There is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of our existing debt.,Financial Risk
"Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase.",Financial Risk
"Should we incur future increases in interest expense, our ability to utilize certain of our foreign tax credits to reduce our U.S. federal income tax could be limited, which could unfavorably affect our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate.",Financial Risk
"In addition, changes to our outlook or credit rating or a withdrawal by any rating agency could negatively affect the value of both our debt and equity securities and increase the interest amounts we pay on certain outstanding or future debt.",Financial Risk

"Economic and Strategic Risks 

Intel Corporation&#8217;s dominance of the microprocessor market and its aggressive business practices may limit our ability to compete effectively on a level playing field.",Market Risk
Intel Corporation (Intel) has been the market share leader for microprocessors for many years.,Technology Risk
"Intel&#8217;s market share, margins and significant financial resources enable it to market its products aggressively, to target our customers and our channel partners with special incentives and to influence customers who do business with us.",Security Risk
These aggressive activities have in the past resulted in lower unit sales and a lower average selling price for many of our products and adversely affected our margins and profitability.,Business Risk
Intel exerts substantial influence over computer manufacturers and their channels of distribution through various brand and other marketing programs.,Market Risk
"As a result of Intel&#8217;s position in the microprocessor market, Intel has been able to control x86 microprocessor and computer system standards and benchmarks and to dictate the type of products the microprocessor market requires of us.",Market Risk
"Intel also dominates the computer system platform, which includes core logic chipsets, graphics chips, networking devices (wired and wireless), non-volatile storage and other components necessary to assemble a computer system.",Technology Risk
"Additionally, Intel is able to drive de facto standards and specifications for x86 microprocessors that could cause us and other companies to have delayed access to such standards.",Technology Risk
"As long as Intel remains in this dominant position, we may be materially adversely affected by Intel&#8217;s business practices, including rebating and allocation strategies and pricing actions, designed to limit our market share and margins; product mix and introduction schedules; product bundling, marketing and merchandising strategies; exclusivity payments to its current and potential customers, retailers and channel partners; de facto control over industry standards, and heavy influence on PC manufacturers and other PC industry participants, including motherboard, memory, chipset and basic input/output system (BIOS) suppliers and software companies as well as the graphics interface for Intel platforms; and marketing and advertising expenditures in support of positioning the Intel brand over the brand of its original equipment manufacturer (OEM) customers and retailers.",Business Risk
Intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on marketing and research and development than we do.,Technology Risk
"We expect Intel to continue to invest heavily in marketing, research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies.",Technology Risk
"To the extent Intel manufactures a significantly larger portion of its microprocessor products using more advanced process technologies, or introduces competitive new products into the market before we do, we may be more vulnerable to Intel&#8217;s aggressive marketing and pricing strategies for microprocessor products.",Market Risk
"Intel could also take actions that place our discrete graphics processing units (GPUs) at a competitive disadvantage, including giving one or more of our competitors in the graphics market, such as NVIDIA Corporation, preferential access to its proprietary graphics interface or other useful information or restricting access to external companies.",Technology Risk
"Also, Intel has developed and released their own high-end discrete GPUs, including gaming focused discrete GPUs.",Technology Risk
We also compete with Intel in field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and Adaptive SoC products.,Market Risk
"Intel&#8217;s position in the microprocessor, and integrated graphics chipset markets, its introduction of competitive new products, its existing relationships with top-tier OEMs, and its aggressive marketing and pricing strategies could result in lower unit sales and lower average selling prices for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on us.",Technology Risk
Global economic and market uncertainty may adversely impact our business and operating results.,Market Risk
We experienced a decline in our Client segment revenue as a result of weak PC market macroeconomic conditions and inventory correction actions across the PC supply chain in the second half of 2022.,Market Risk
Uncertain global economic conditions have and may in the future adversely impact our business.,Business Risk
"Uncertainty in the worldwide economic environment or other unfavorable changes in economic conditions, such as inflation, interest rates or recession, may negatively impact consumer confidence and spending causing our customers to postpone purchases.",Market Risk
"In addition, during challenging economic times, our current or potential future customers may experience cash flow problems and as a result may modify, delay or cancel plans to purchase our products.",Business Risk
"Additionally, if our customers are not successful in generating sufficient revenue or are unable to secure financing, they may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of, accounts receivable that they owe us.",Financial Risk
The risk related to our customers potentially defaulting on or delaying payments to us is increased because we expect that a small number of customers will continue to account for a substantial part of our revenue.,Financial Risk
"Any inability of our current or potential future customers to pay us for 

our products may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow.",Financial Risk

"Also, the semiconductor industry has seen several mergers and acquisitions over the last number of years.",Market Risk
"Further consolidation could adversely impact our business due to there being fewer suppliers, customers and partners in the industry.",Business Risk
Our operating results are subject to quarterly and seasonal sales patterns.,General Risk
The profile of our sales may be weighted differently during the year.,Market Risk
A large portion of our quarterly sales have historically been made in the last month of the quarter.,Market Risk
This uneven sales pattern makes prediction of revenue for each financial period difficult and increases the risk of unanticipated variations in quarterly results and financial condition.,Financial Risk
"In addition, our operating results tend to vary seasonally with the markets in which our products are sold.",Market Risk

"In jurisdictions where foreign laws provide less intellectual property protection than afforded in the United States and abroad, our technology or other intellectual property may be compromised, and our business would be materially adversely affected.",Legal Risk
Unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect us.,Business Risk
"We have costs, assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies.",Financial Risk
"As a consequence, movements in exchange rates could cause our foreign currency denominated expenses to increase as a percentage of revenue, affecting our profitability and cash flows.",Business Risk
"Whenever we believe appropriate, we hedge a portion of our foreign currency exposure to protect against fluctuations in currency exchange rates.",Financial Risk
We determine our total foreign currency exposure using projections of long-term expenditures for items such as payroll.,Financial Risk
We cannot assure you that these activities will be effective in reducing foreign exchange rate exposure.,Market Risk
"Failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.",Financial Risk

We cannot guarantee that these manufacturers or our other third-party manufacturing suppliers will be able to meet our near-term or long-term manufacturing requirements.,Business Risk
"If we experience supply constraints from our third-party manufacturing suppliers, we may be required to allocate the reduced quantities of affected products amongst our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our relationships with these customers and on our financial condition.",Business Risk
"In addition, if we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from our manufacturing suppliers, it could result in lost sales and have a material adverse effect on our business.",Business Risk
"For example, if TSMC is not able to manufacture wafers for our microprocessor and GPU products at 7 nm or smaller nodes and our newest IC products in sufficient quantities to meet customer demand, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.",Business Risk
We do not have long-term commitment contracts with some of our third-party manufacturing suppliers.,Business Risk
We obtain some of these manufacturing services on a purchase order basis and these manufacturers are not required to provide us with any specified minimum quantity of product beyond the quantities in an existing purchase order.,Market Risk
"Accordingly, we depend on these suppliers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis and at acceptable prices.",General Risk
"The manufacturers we use also fabricate wafers and ATMP products for other companies, including certain of our competitors.",Technology Risk
"They could choose to prioritize capacity for other customers, increase the prices that they charge us on short notice, require onerous prepayments, or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.",Business Risk
"Other risks associated with our dependence on third-party manufacturers include limited control over delivery schedules, yield, cycle times, quality assurance, price increases, lack of capacity in periods of excess demand, misappropriation of our intellectual property, dependence on several subcontractors, and limited ability to manage inventory and parts.",Business Risk

"In May 2021, we entered into an amendment to the WSA, and in December 2021, we further amended these terms (the Amendment).",Legal Risk
"Under the Amendment, GF will provide a minimum annual capacity allocation to us for years 2022 through 2025 and AMD has corresponding annual wafer purchase targets.",Technology Risk
"If we do not meet the annual wafer purchase target for any of these years, we will be required to pay to GF a portion of the difference between the actual wafer purchases and the wafer purchase target for that year.",General Risk
"AMD and GF also have agreed to wafer pricing through 2025, and AMD was obligated in 2022 and is obligated in 2023 to pre-pay GF certain amounts for those wafers.",Technology Risk
The Amendment no longer includes any exclusivity commitments and provides us with full flexibility to contract with any wafer foundry with respect to all products manufactured at any technology node.,Business Risk
"If our actual wafer requirements are less than the number of wafers required to meet the applicable annual wafer purchase target, we could have excess inventory or higher inventory unit costs, both of which may adversely impact our gross margin and our results of operations.",Business Risk
"If GF fails to meet its minimum annual capacity allocation obligations, we could experience significant delays in the shipment of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.",Business Risk
"We are party to two ATMP joint ventures (collectively, the ATMP JVs) with affiliates of Tongfu Microelectronics Co., Ltd.",Legal Risk
The majority of our ATMP services are provided by the ATMP JVs and there is no guarantee that the ATMP JVs will be able to fulfill our long-term ATMP requirements.,Technology Risk
"If we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from the ATMP JVs, it could result in lost sales and have a material adverse effect on our business.",Business Risk
"If essential equipment, materials, substrates or manufacturing processes are not available to manufacture our products, we could be materially adversely affected.",Business Risk
"We may purchase equipment, materials and substrates for use by our back-end manufacturing service providers from a number of suppliers and our operations depend upon obtaining deliveries of adequate supplies of equipment and materials on a timely basis.",Business Risk
Our third-party suppliers also depend on the same timely delivery of adequate quantities of equipment and materials in the manufacture of our products.,Business Risk
"In addition, as many of our products increase in technical complexity, we rely on our third-party suppliers to update their processes in order to continue meeting our back-end manufacturing needs.",Technology Risk
"Certain equipment and materials that are used in the manufacture of our products are available only from a limited number of suppliers, or in some cases, a sole supplier.",Technology Risk

"If we are unable to procure a stable supply of equipment, materials or substrates on an ongoing basis and at reasonable costs to meet our production requirements, we could experience a shortage in equipment, materials or substrate supply or an increase in production costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.",Business Risk
We have long-term purchase commitments and prepayment arrangements with some of our suppliers.,Financial Risk
"If the delivery of such supply is delayed or does not occur for any reason, it could materially impact our ability to procure and process the required volume of supply to meet customer demand.",Business Risk
"Conversely, a decrease in customer demand could result in excess inventory and an increase in our production costs, particularly since we have prepayment arrangements with certain suppliers.",Business Risk
"Because some of the equipment and materials that we and our third-party manufacturers purchase are complex, it is sometimes difficult to substitute one equipment or materials supplier for another.",Market Risk
"From time to time, suppliers may extend lead times, limit supply or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors.",Market Risk
"Also, some of these materials and components may be subject to rapid changes in price and availability.",Market Risk
Interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry could cause shortages and price increases in various essential materials.,Market Risk
Dependence on a sole supplier or a limited number of suppliers exacerbates these risks.,Business Risk
"If we are unable to procure certain of these materials for our back-end manufacturing operations, or our third-party manufacturers are unable to procure materials for manufacturing our products, our business would be materially adversely affected.",Business Risk
Failure to achieve expected manufacturing yields for our products could negatively impact our financial results.,Business Risk
"Semiconductor manufacturing yields are a result of product design, process technology and packaging technology, which is typically proprietary to the manufacturer, and low yields can result from design failures, packaging technology failures, process technology failures or a combination of some or all of these.",Technology Risk
Our third-party manufacturers are responsible for the process technologies used to fabricate silicon wafers.,Technology Risk
"If our third-party manufacturers experience manufacturing inefficiencies or encounter disruptions, errors or difficulties during production, we may fail to achieve acceptable yields or we may experience product delivery delays.",Business Risk
"We cannot be certain that our third-party manufacturers will be able to develop, obtain or successfully implement leading-edge process or packaging technologies needed to manufacture future generations of our products profitably or on a timely basis or that our competitors will not develop new technologies, products or processes earlier.",Technology Risk
"Moreover, during periods when our third-party manufacturers are implementing new process or packaging technologies, their manufacturing facilities may not be fully productive.",Technology Risk
"A substantial delay in the technology transitions to smaller process technologies could have a material adverse effect on us, particularly if our competitors transition to more cost effective technologies before us.",Technology Risk
"For example, we are presently focusing our 7 nm and lower product microprocessor and GPU portfolio on TSMC&#8217;s processes.",Technology Risk
"If TSMC is not able to manufacture wafers for our products at 7 nm or smaller nodes in sufficient quantities to meet customer demand, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.",Business Risk
"Moreover, we rely on TSMC, UMC and our other foundries to produce wafers with competitive performance attributes for our IC products.",Technology Risk
"Therefore, the foundries, particularly TSMC which manufactures our newest IC products, must be able to transition to advanced manufacturing process technologies and increased wafer sizes, produce wafers at acceptable yields and deliver them in a timely manner.",Technology Risk
"Any decrease in manufacturing yields could result in an increase in per unit costs, which would adversely impact our gross margin and/or force us to allocate our reduced product supply amongst our customers, which could harm our relationships and reputation with our customers and materially adversely affect our business.",Business Risk
The success of our business is dependent upon our ability to introduce products on a timely basis with features and performance levels that provide value to our customers while supporting and coinciding with significant industry transitions.,General Risk

"If our customers do not include our products in the initial design of their computer systems or products, they will typically not use our products in their systems or products until at least the next design configuration.",Technology Risk
"The process of being qualified for inclusion in a customer&#8217;s system or product can be lengthy and could cause us to further miss a cycle in the demand of end-users, which also could result in a loss of market share and harm our business.",Business Risk
We also depend on the success and timing of our customers&#8217; platform launches.,Technology Risk
"If our customers delay their product launches or if our customers do not effectively market their platforms with our products, it could result in a delay in bringing our products to market and cause us to miss a cycle in the demand of end-users, which could materially adversely affect our business.",Business Risk
"In addition, market demand requires that products incorporate new features and performance standards on an industry-wide basis.",Technology Risk
"Over the life of a specific product, the sale price is typically reduced over time.",Market Risk
The introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products is necessary to maintain the overall corporate average selling price.,Market Risk
"If we are unable to introduce new products with sufficiently high sale prices or to increase unit sales volumes capable of offsetting the reductions in the sale prices of existing products over time, our business could be materially adversely affected.",Business Risk
Our revenue from our semi-custom SoC products is dependent upon our semi-custom SoC products being incorporated into customers&#8217; products and the success of those products.,Technology Risk
The revenue that we receive from our semi-custom SoC products is in the form of non-recurring engineering fees charged to third parties for design and development services and revenue received in connection with sales of our semi-custom SoC products to these third parties.,Market Risk
"As a result, our ability to generate revenue from our semi-custom products depends on our ability to secure customers for our semi-custom design pipeline, our customers&#8217; desire to pursue the project and our semi-custom SoC products being incorporated into those customers&#8217; products.",Business Risk
Any revenue from sales of our semi-custom SoC products is directly related to sales of the third-party&#8217;s products and reflective of their success in the market.,Technology Risk
"Moreover, we have no control over the marketing efforts of these third parties, and we cannot make any assurances that sales of their products will be successful in current or future years.",Business Risk

"We anticipate ongoing and increasing costs related to enhancing and implementing information security controls, including costs related to upgrading application, computer, and network security components; training workers to maintain and monitor our security controls; investigating, responding to and remediating any data security breach, and addressing any related litigation; mitigating reputational harm; and complying with external regulations.",Security Risk
We often partner with third-party providers for certain worker services and we may provide certain limited worker information to such third parties based on the scope of the services provided to us.,General Risk
"We also provide sensitive information to vendors, customers and contractors.",Security Risk
"If these third parties fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practices, or in the event of a breach of their networks, our workers&#8217; data and sensitive information may be improperly accessed, used or disclosed.",Security Risk
A breach of data privacy may cause significant disruption of our business operations.,Business Risk
Failure to adequately maintain and update our security systems could materially adversely affect our operations and our ability to maintain worker confidence.,Security Risk
"Failure to prevent unauthorized access to electronic and other confidential information, IT outages, data loss and data breaches could materially adversely affect our financial condition, our competitive position and operating results.",Security Risk
"We may encounter difficulties in upgrading and operating our new enterprise resource planning system, which could materially adversely affect us.",Business Risk
We are currently upgrading our enterprise resource planning (ERP) system to help us manage our operations and financial reporting.,Technology Risk
"The adoption of a new ERP system is a major undertaking and poses several challenges, both financially and from a management and personnel perspective.",Technology Risk
"Costs and risks inherent in the conversion to our upgraded and new system may include disruption s to business continuity, difficulty in maintaining effective internal controls, administrative and technical problems, interruptions or delays in sales processes, expenditure overruns, and data migration issues.",Business Risk
"If we do not properly address or mitigate these issues it could result in increased costs and the diversion of management&#8217;s attention and resources, negatively impacting our operating results and ability to effectively manage our business.",Business Risk
"Moreover, once our ERP system is upgraded, it may not operate as we expect it to 

and cause disruption to our operations.",Technology Risk
There are no assurances that our new ERP system will be successfully implemented and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business.,Technology Risk
Uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of our products could materially adversely affect us.,Business Risk
We typically sell our products pursuant to individual purchase orders.,Market Risk
We generally do not have long-term supply arrangements with our customers or minimum purchase requirements except that orders generally must be for standard pack quantities.,General Risk
"Generally, our customers may cancel orders for standard products more than 30 days prior to shipment without incurring significant fees.",Market Risk
"We base our inventory levels in part on customers&#8217; estimates of demand for their products, which may not accurately predict the quantity or type of our products that our customers will want in the future or ultimately end up purchasing.",Business Risk
"Our ability to forecast demand is even further complicated when our products are sold indirectly through downstream channel distributors and customers, as our forecasts for demand are then based on estimates provided by multiple parties throughout the downstream channel.",Market Risk
"For instance, we have experienced and continue to experience increased demand for our products.",Market Risk
"To the extent we fail to forecast demand and product mix accurately or are unable to increase production or secure sufficient capacity and there is a mismatch between supply and demand for our products, it could limit our ability to meet customer demand and have a material adverse effect on our business.",Business Risk
"Many of our markets are characterized by short product lifecycles, which can lead to rapid obsolescence and price erosion.",Market Risk
"In addition, our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason.",Business Risk
"For example, in the second half of 2022, we experienced a decline in our Client segment revenue as a result of weak PC market macroeconomic conditions and inventory correction actions across the PC supply chain.",Market Risk
"We may build inventories during periods of anticipated growth, and the cancellation or deferral of product orders or overproduction due to failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of inventory and an adverse effect on gross margins.",Business Risk
"Our customers may also experience a shortage of, or delay in receiving certain components to build their products, which in turn may affect the demand for or the timing of our products.",Market Risk
"For instance, OEMs have and continue to experience industry-wide challenges securing matched component sets to build their products.",Security Risk
Excess or obsolete inventory have and may in the future result in write-downs of the value of our inventory.,Business Risk
"For example, in the third quarter of 2022, we recorded certain charges primarily for inventory, pricing and related reserves in the Gaming and Client segments.",Market Risk
"Other factors that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include, a reduction in the average selling price, or a reduction in our gross margin include: a sudden or significant decrease in demand for our products; a production or design defect in our products; a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements; a failure to accurately estimate customer demand for our products, including for our older products as our new products are introduced; or our competitors introducing new products or taking aggressive pricing actions.",Business Risk
Our ability to design and introduce new products in a timely manner includes use of third-party intellectual property.,Technology Risk
"In the design and development of new and enhanced products, we rely on third-party intellectual property such as development and testing tools for software and hardware.",Technology Risk
"Furthermore, certain product features may rely on intellectual property acquired from third parties.",Legal Risk
The design requirements necessary to meet customer demand for more features and greater functionality from semiconductor products may exceed the capabilities of the third-party intellectual property or development or testing tools available to us.,Technology Risk
"If the third-party intellectual property that we use becomes unavailable, is not available with required functionality or performance in the time frame, manufacturing technology, or price point needed for our new products or fails to produce designs that meet customer demands, or laws are adopted that affect our use of third party intellectual property in certain regions or products, our business could be materially adversely affected.",Business Risk
"We depend on third-party companies for the design, manufacture and supply of motherboards, software, memory and other computer platform components to support our business and products.",Technology Risk
"We depend on third-party companies for the design, manufacture and supply of motherboards, graphics cards, software (e.g., BIOS, operating systems, drivers), memory and other components that we use to design, support and sell, and our customers utilize to support and/or use our product offerings.",Technology Risk
We also rely on our AIB partners to support our products.,Financial Risk
"In addition, our microprocessors are not designed to function with motherboards and chipsets designed to work with Intel microprocessors.",Technology Risk
"If the designers, manufacturers, AIBs and suppliers of motherboards, graphics cards, software, memory and other components cease or reduce their design, manufacture or production 

of current or future products that are based on, utilized in, or support our products, or laws are adopted that result in the same, our business could be materially adversely affected.",Business Risk
"If we lose Microsoft Corporation&#8217;s support for our products or other software vendors do not design and develop software to run on our products, our ability to sell our products could be materially adversely affected.",Business Risk
Our ability to innovate beyond the x86 instruction set controlled by Intel depends partially on Microsoft designing and developing its operating systems to run on or support our x86-based microprocessor products.,Technology Risk
"With respect to our graphics products, we depend in part on Microsoft to design and develop its operating system to run on or support our graphics products.",Technology Risk
"Similarly, the success of our products in the market, such as our APU products, is dependent on independent software providers designing and developing software to run on our products.",Market Risk
"If Microsoft does not continue to design and develop its operating systems so that they work with our x86 instruction sets or does not continue to develop and maintain their operating systems to support our graphics products, independent software providers may forego designing their software applications to take advantage of our innovations and customers may not purchase PCs with our products.",Technology Risk
"In addition, some software drivers licensed for use with our products are certified by Microsoft.",Technology Risk
"If Microsoft did not certify a driver, or if we otherwise fail to retain the support of Microsoft or other software vendors, our ability to market our products would be materially adversely affected.",Market Risk
Our reliance on third-party distributors and AIB partners subjects us to certain risks.,Business Risk
We market and sell our products directly and through third-party distributors and AIB partners pursuant to agreements that can generally be terminated for convenience by either party upon prior notice to the other party.,Legal Risk
These agreements are non-exclusive and permit both our distributors and AIB partners to offer our competitors&#8217; products.,General Risk
We are dependent on our distributors and AIB partners to supplement our direct marketing and sales efforts.,Market Risk
"If any significant distributor or AIB partner or a substantial number of our distributors or AIB partners terminated their relationship with us, decided to market our competitors&#8217; products over our products or decided not to market our products at all, our ability to bring our products to market would be impacted and we would be materially adversely affected.",Business Risk
"In addition, if we are unable to collect accounts receivable from our significant distributors and/or AIB partners, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.",Business Risk
"If we are unable to manage the risks related to the use of our third-party distributors and AIB partners or offer appropriate incentives to focus them on the sale of our products, our business could be materially adversely affected.",Business Risk
"Additionally, distributors and AIB partners typically maintain an inventory of our products.",Market Risk
"In most instances, our agreements with distributors protect their inventory of our products against price reductions, as well as provide return rights for any product that we have removed from our price book that is less than 12 months older than the manufacturing date.",Business Risk
Some agreements with our distributors also contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns.,Market Risk
Our agreements with AIB partners protect their inventory of our products against price reductions.,Business Risk
"In the event of a significant decline in the price of our products, the price protection rights we offer would materially adversely affect us because our revenue and corresponding gross margin would decline.",Business Risk
"Our business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our internal business processes and information systems and modification or interruption of such systems may disrupt our business, processes and internal controls.",Business Risk
"We rely upon a number of internal business processes and information systems to support key business functions, and the efficient operation of these processes and systems is critical to our business.",Market Risk
Our business processes and information systems need to be sufficiently scalable to support the growth of our business and may require modifications or upgrades that expose us to a number of operational risks.,Business Risk
"As such, our information systems will continually evolve and adapt in order to meet our business needs.",Market Risk
These changes may be costly and disruptive to our operations and could impose substantial demands on management time.,Business Risk
"These changes may also require changes in our information systems, modification of internal control procedures and significant training of employees and third-party resources.",Security Risk
We continuously work on simplifying our information systems and applications through consolidation and standardization efforts.,Market Risk
There can be no assurance that our business and operations will not experience any disruption in connection with this transition.,Business Risk
"Our information technology systems, and those of third-party information technology providers or business partners, may also be vulnerable to damage or disruption caused by circumstances beyond our control including catastrophic events, 

power anomalies or outages, natural disasters, viruses or malware, cyber-attacks, insider threat attacks, unauthorized system or data modifications, data breaches and computer system or network failures, exposing us to significant cost, reputational harm and disruption or damage to our business.",Technology Risk
"In addition, as our IT environment continues to evolve, we are embracing new ways of communicating and sharing data internally and externally with customers and partners using methods such as mobility and the cloud that can promote business efficiency.",Technology Risk
"However, these practices can also result in a more distributed IT environment, making it more difficult for us to maintain visibility and control over internal and external users, and meet scalability and administrative requirements.",Technology Risk
"If our security controls cannot keep pace with the speed of these changes, or if we are not able to meet regulatory and compliance requirements, our business would be materially adversely affected.",Security Risk
"If our products are not compatible with some or all industry-standard software and hardware, we could be materially adversely affected.",Technology Risk
Our products may not be fully compatible with some or all industry-standard software and hardware.,Technology Risk
"Further, we may be unsuccessful in correcting any such compatibility problems in a timely manner.",Technology Risk
"If our customers are unable to achieve compatibility with software or hardware, we could be materially adversely affected.",Business Risk
"In addition, the mere announcement of an incompatibility problem relating to our products could have a material adverse effect on our business.",Business Risk
Costs related to defective products could have a material adverse effect on us.,Business Risk
Products as complex as those we offer may contain defects or failures when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements to existing products are released.,Technology Risk
"We cannot assure you that, despite our testing procedures, errors will not be found in new products or releases after commencement of commercial shipments in the future, which could result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products, material recall and replacement costs, loss of revenue, writing down the inventory of defective products, the diversion of the attention of our engineering personnel from product development efforts, defending against litigation related to defective products or related liabilities, including property damage, personal injury, damage to our reputation in the industry and loss of data or intangible property, and could adversely affect our relationships with our customers.",Business Risk
"In addition, we may have difficulty identifying the end customers of the defective products in the field.",Market Risk
"As a result, we could incur substantial costs to implement modifications to correct defects.",Business Risk
Any of these problems could materially adversely affect our business.,Business Risk
"We could be subject to potential product liability claims if one of our products causes, or merely appears to have caused, an injury, whether tangible or intangible.",Legal Risk
"Claims may be made by consumers or others selling our products, and we may be subject to claims against us even if an alleged injury is due to the actions of others.",Legal Risk
"A product liability claim, recall or other claim with respect to uninsured liabilities or for amounts in excess of insured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business.",Business Risk
"If we fail to maintain the efficiency of our supply chain as we respond to changes in customer demand for our products, our business could be materially adversely affected.",Business Risk
"Our ability to meet customer demand for our products depends, in part, on our ability to deliver the products our customers want on a timely basis.",Business Risk
"Accordingly, we rely on our supply chain for the manufacturing, distribution and fulfillment of our products.",General Risk
"As we continue to grow our business, expand to high-growth adjacent markets, acquire new customers and strengthen relationships with existing customers, the efficiency of our supply chain will become increasingly important because many of our customers tend to have specific requirements for particular products, geographic requirements, and specific time-frames in which they require delivery of these products.",Market Risk
"If we are unable to consistently deliver the right products to our customers on a timely basis in the right locations, our customers may reduce the quantities they order from us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.",Business Risk
"We outsource to third parties certain supply-chain logistics functions, including portions of our product distribution, transportation management and information technology support services.",Market Risk
"We rely on third-party providers to operate our regional product distribution centers and to manage the transportation of our work-in-process and finished products among our facilities, to our third-party manufacturers and to our customers.",Market Risk
"In addition, we rely on third parties to provide certain information technology services to us, including help desk support, desktop application services, business and software support applications, server and storage administration, data center operations, database administration and voice, video and remote access.",Technology Risk
"We cannot guarantee that these providers will fulfill their respective responsibilities in a timely manner in accordance with the contract terms, in which case our internal operations and the distribution of our products to our customers could be materially adversely affected.",Business Risk
"Also, we cannot guarantee that our contracts with these third-party providers will be renewed, in which case we would have to transition these functions in-house or secure new providers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business if the transition is not executed appropriately.",Business Risk
Our inability to effectively control the sales of our products on the gray market could have a material adverse effect on us.,Business Risk
We market and sell our products directly to OEMs and through authorized third-party distributors.,Market Risk
"From time to time, our products are diverted from our authorized distribution channels and are sold on the &#8220;gray market.&#8221; Gray market products result in shadow inventory that is not visible to us, thus making it difficult to forecast demand accurately.",Market Risk
"Also, when gray market products enter the market, we and our distribution channels compete with these heavily discounted gray market products, which adversely affects demand for our products and negatively impacts our margins.",Market Risk
"In addition, our inability to control gray market activities could result in customer satisfaction issues because any time products are purchased outside our authorized distribution channels there is a risk that our customers are buying counterfeit or substandard products, including products that may have been altered, mishandled or damaged, or are used products represented as new.",Market Risk

"Many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in expected revenues and diversion of management&#8217;s time and attention, which could materially impact the combined company.",Financial Risk
"In addition, even if the operations of the businesses are integrated successfully, the full benefits of the acquisitions may not be realized within the anticipated time frame or at all.",Business Risk
All of these factors could decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the acquisitions and negatively impact the combined company.,Financial Risk
"If we cannot successfully integrate our and the acquired companies&#8217; businesses and operations, or if there are delays in combining the businesses, it could negatively impact our ability to develop or sell new products and impair our ability to grow our business, which in turn could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.",Business Risk
Acquisitions and joint ventures may also involve the entry into geographic or business markets in which we have little or no prior experience.,Market Risk
"Consequently, we may not achieve anticipated benefits of acquisitions or joint ventures, which could harm our operating results.",Business Risk
"In addition, to complete an acquisition, we may issue equity securities, which would dilute our stockholders&#8217; ownership and could adversely affect the price of our common stock, and/or incur debt, assume contingent liabilities or have amortization expenses and write-downs of acquired assets, which could adversely affect our results of operations.",Financial Risk
"Moreover, if such acquisitions or joint ventures require us to seek additional debt or equity financing, we may not be able to obtain such financing on terms favorable to us or at all.",Financial Risk
"Even if we successfully complete an acquisition or joint venture, we may not be able to assimilate and integrate effectively or efficiently the acquired business, technologies, solutions, assets, personnel or operations, particularly if key personnel of the acquired company decide not to work for us.",Business Risk
"Acquisitions and joint ventures may also reduce our cash available for operations and other uses, which could harm our business.",Business Risk

"If, in the future, we determine that tangible or intangible assets, including goodwill, are impaired, we would record an impairment charge at that time.",Business Risk
"Impairment testing of goodwill requires significant use of judgment and assumptions, particularly as it relates to the determination of fair value.",Business Risk
"Subsequent to our annual goodwill impairment analysis, we monitor for any events or changes in circumstances, such as significant adverse changes in business climate or operating results, changes in management&#8217;s business strategy, an inability to successfully introduce new products in the marketplace, an inability to successfully achieve internal forecasts or significant declines in our stock price, which may represent an indicator of impairment.",Business Risk
"A decrease in the long-term economic outlook and future cash flows of our business could significantly impact asset values and potentially result in the impairment of goodwill and may require us to record future goodwill impairment charges, which may have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations.",Business Risk
